Ad sales boost Time Warner profit,"TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn.For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn.Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues.Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters.Time Warner's fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts' expectations"
Dollar gains on Greenspan speech,"The dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.China's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive.Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months.""I think the chairman's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time,"" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York.The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US's yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments.""He's taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next."
Yukos unit buyer faces loan claim,"Yukos' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.State-owned Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by Russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against Yukos.The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft.But the company has said it intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk.""The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets,"" said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case"
High fuel prices hit BA's profits,"Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, said the results were ""respectable"" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3%.To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.""It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,"" he said.Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's estimated annual surcharge revenues - £160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £250m.""For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,"" BA chairman Martin Broughton said.Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers.BA's profits were still better than market expectation of £59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues"
Pernod takeover talk lifts Domecq,"Pernod has reduced the debt it took on to fund the Seagram purchase to just 1.8bn euros, while Allied has improved the performance of its fast-food chains.Shares in UK drinks and food firm Allied Domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by France's Pernod Ricard.Pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics.In terms of market value, Pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than Allied Domecq, which has a capitalisation of £5.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros).Allied Domecq shares in London rose 4% by 1200 GMT, while Pernod shares in Paris slipped 1.2%"
Japan narrowly escapes recession,"On an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought.A common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.Revised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter.Japan's economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to September, figures show"
Jobs growth still slow in the US,"The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office.Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions.The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.""The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,"" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover"
India calls for fair trade rules,"At a conference on developing enterprise hosted by UK finance minister Gordon Brown on Friday, he said that he was in favour of floating exchange rates because they help countries cope with economic shocks.In London on Thursday ahead of the meeting, India's finance minister, lashed out at the restrictive trade policies of the G7 nations.Mr Chidambaram is attending the G7 meeting as part of the G20 group of nations, which account for two thirds of the world's population.China is expected to face renewed pressure to abandon its fixed exchange rate, which G7 nations, in particular the US, have blamed for a surge in cheap Chinese exports.Palaniappan Chidambaram, India's finance minister, argued that these organisations need to take into account the changing world order, given India and China's integration into the global economy.India, along with China, Brazil, South Africa and Russia, has been invited to take part in the G7 meeting taking place in London on Friday and Saturday"
Ethiopia's crop production up 24%,"In 2003, crop production totalled 11.49 million tonnes, the joint report from the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme said.The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) recommend that the food assistance is bought locally.Last year, a total of 965,000 tonnes of food assistance was needed to help seven million Ethiopians.The report calculated emergency food requirements for 2005 to be 387,500 tonnes.On top of that, 89,000 tonnes of fortified blended food and vegetable oil for ""targeted supplementary food distributions for a survival programme for children under five and pregnant and lactating women"" will be needed"
Court rejects $280bn tobacco case,"A US government claim accusing the country's biggest tobacco companies of covering up the effects of smoking has been thrown out by an appeal court.The tobacco companies deny that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public.In its case, the government claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction, targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns, lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary.Shares of tobacco companies closed higher after the ruling, with Altria rising 5% and Reynolds showing gains of 4.5%"
Ask Jeeves tips online ad revival,"Ask Jeeves has become the third leading online search firm this week to thank a revival in internet advertising for improving fortunes.Its $17m profit for the quarter was dwarfed by the $204m announced by rival Google earlier in the week.During the same quarter, Yahoo earned $187m, again tipping a resurgence in online advertising.Neither Ask Jeeves nor Doubleclick thrilled investors with their profit news, however.Ask Jeeves, once among the best-known names on the web, is now a relatively modest player"
Indonesians face fuel price rise,"Indonesia's government has confirmed it is considering raising fuel prices by as much as 30%.Indonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices, but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down.Since President Yudhoyono's government came to power in October, it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies.President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor.Indonesia's previous government, led by President Megawati Sukarnoputri, also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003, but was forced to back down in the face of public protests.But critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help"
Peugeot deal boosts Mitsubishi,"Struggling Japanese car maker Mitsubishi Motors has struck a deal to supply French car maker Peugeot with 30,000 sports utility vehicles (SUV).Mitsubishi Motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to March 2005.Last month, it signed a production agreement with Japanese rival Nissan Motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in Japan.In January, Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine months, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March 2005.Falling sales have left Mitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.As a result, the Japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts"
Telegraph newspapers axe 90 jobs,"""Journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper, and maintaining the quality of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for our readers is vital,"" he said.The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.Telegraph executive Murdoch MacLennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months.The Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers are axing 90 journalist jobs - 17% of their editorial staff.The Telegraph Group says the cuts are needed to fund an £150m investment in new printing facilities.The National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike.The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size.Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages, or in some cases, have colour on every page.NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies"
Air passengers win new EU rights,"In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.However, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to ""extraordinary circumstances"".""We reckon it's going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that's over £1bn a year loaded onto European passengers,"" Mr Clarke said.When this happens against a passenger's will, airlines will now have to offer compensation.All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday.The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights.Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.Air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.However, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket.The EC has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added"
China keeps tight rein on credit,"The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year.Rapid tooling-up of China's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year.Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year.The curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices.In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a ""hard landing"" in the shape of an overbalancing economy"
Parmalat boasts doubled profits,"On Tuesday, the company's administrator, turnaround expert Enrico Bondi, sued Morgan Stanley, its former banker, to return 136m euros relating to a 2003 bond deal.The company has also sued former auditors and financial advisors for damages.That brought to 49 the number of banks that Mr Bondi has sued, a mass of legal action that could bring in as much as 3bn euros.And criminal cases against the company's former management are proceeding separately.Overall, the company's debt is close to 12bn euros, and is falling only slowly"
India's rupee hits five-year high,"India's rupee has hit a five-year high after Standard & Poor's (S&P) raised the country's foreign currency rating.India's foreign currency rating is now one notch below investment grade, which starts at 'BBB-'.S&P, which rates borrowers' creditworthiness, lifted India's rating by one notch to 'BB+'.The currency has gained almost 1% in the past three sessions"
India widens access to telecoms,"""We need at least $20bn (£10.6bn) in investment and part of this has to come as foreign direct investment,"" said Mr Maran.Potential foreign investors will however need government approval before they increase their stake beyond 49%, Mr Maran said.Communications Minister Dayanidhi Maran said that there is a need to fund the fast-growing mobile market.India has raised the limit for foreign direct investment in telecoms companies from 49% to 74%.Investment bank Morgan Stanley has forecast that India's mobile market is likely to grow by about 40% a year until 2007"
Call centre users 'lose patience',"The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year.Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers.In what Dimension Data calls an ""alarming development"", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving ""agents not equipped to deal with customers"".And if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job?There are ""no big differences in wait time and call resolution"" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world.Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.Suggestions that ""outsourcing"" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres' growing range of tasks.What are your experiences with call centres?However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year.The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents.As a result, call centres have a high ""churn rate"", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff"
Rank 'set to sell off film unit',"Leisure group Rank could unveil plans to demerge its film services unit and sell its media business, reports claim.Rank now aims to concentrate on its gaming, bars and hotels business, including extending its Hard Rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success.Since Mike Smith's appointment as chief executive in 1999, the group has focused on fewer businesses and embarked on a major cost-cutting programme which has seen it dispose of a number of businesses, including the Odeon cinema chain and the Pinewood studios.The move left the group with three core divisions: gaming, Hard Rock and Deluxe Films, which provides technical services to Hollywood studios.Speculation of a possible shake-up has mounted since Rank announced a study into a possible demerger in September.Analysts predict the firm is likely to report a slight drop in annual pre-tax profits to £170m from £194m last year"
Sluggish economy hits German jobs,"But officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market.With unemployment stuck above 4 million for years, the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda.The seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller rise than expected, as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect.""But growth of 0.1%... in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market.""""Job creation measures probably prevented a stronger increase in the seasonally adjusted numbers.""""The deterioration of the labour market does not come as a surprise,"" said Isabelle Kronawitter at Hypovereinsbank"
Mixed signals from French economy,"Despite the apparent shortfall in annual economic growth, the good quarterly figures - a so-called ""flash estimate"" - mark a continuing trend of improving indicators for the health of the French economy.Also on Friday, France's industrial output for December was released, showing 0.7% growth.It leaves GDP up 2.3% for the full year, but short of the 2.5% which the French government had predicted.Service sector activity improved in January, hitting a seven-month high.But unemployment remains high at about 10%"
US trade gap hits record in 2004,"The Commerce Department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003's imbalance of $496.5bn.The gap between US exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (£484bn) in 2004, latest figures show.However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to £56.4bn.The US consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush's economic policies.For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion.For example, they believe China's currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China's rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors"
Yukos loses US bankruptcy battle,"The court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of Yugansk, which Yukos claims was illegally sold.Yukos had argued that a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore lives in Houston.A judge has dismissed an attempt by Russian oil giant Yukos to gain bankruptcy protection in the US.Texas Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of a US presence to establish US jurisdiction.Yukos claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection.Yukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling.""The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia,"" Judge Clark said in her ruling.Yukos filed for Chapter 11 protection in Houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its Yugansk division by the Russian authorities.The US court's jurisdiction had been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft.Russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the US courts"
Safety alert as GM recalls cars,"The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said.The NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open.The world's biggest carmaker General Motors (GM) is recalling nearly 200,000 vehicles in the US on safety grounds, according to federal regulators.News of the recall follows an announcement last month that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004.In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the largest recall involves 155,465 pickups, vans and sports utility vehicles (SUVs)"
"Steel firm 'to cut' 45,000 jobs","Mittal Steel, one of the world's largest steel producers, could cut up to 45,000 jobs over the next five years, its chief executive has said.Mittal Steel has operations in 14 countries.Mr Mittal told US investors that once the acquisition of International Steel Group was completed, the company would aim to reduce its workforce by between 7,000 and 8,000 annually.A Mittal Steel spokeman said that no decisions on job cuts have been made yet.Mittal Steel was formed last year when Mr Mittal's LNM Holdings merged with Dutch firm Ispat.However, Lakshmi Mittal has told investors the combined company will have to shed thousands of jobs"
Strong demand triggers oil rally,"Crude oil prices surged back above the $47 a barrel mark on Thursday after an energy market watchdog raised its forecasts for global demand.The US Department of Energy reported that crude stockpiles had fallen 1m barrels to 294.3m.The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned demand for Opec's crude in the first quarter would outstrip supply.The IEA raised its estimate of 2005 oil demand growth by 80,000 barrels a day to 84 million barrels a day"
UK firm faces Venezuelan land row,"The Vestey Group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities.Officials in Cojedes state said on Friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the Vestey Group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers.Venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a British company as part of President Chavez's agrarian reform programme.Last month, the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40,000.The firm, whose Agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in Venezuela, insisted that it had complied fully with Venezuelan law.Under President Chavez, the Venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state's involvement in the country's economy.The authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had ""nothing to fear"".The Vestey Group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure"
Soaring oil 'hits world economy',"US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said.But the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said.Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006.The soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world's major economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the OECD.""The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.""If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters,"" Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC's World Business Report.A dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said"
Irish markets reach all-time high,"Irish shares have risen to a record high, with investors persuaded to buy into the market by low inflation and strong growth forecasts.""Buoyant economic conditions are set to continue in Ireland over the next few years and Irish equities continue to offer quality growth at a reasonable valuation.""Ireland's economic 'miracle' is enjoying a second wind, with 5% growth forecast for 2005 and 2006.The ISEQ index of leading shares closed up 23 points to 6661.89 on Thursday, fuelled by strong growth in banking and financial stocks.The economy is set for strong growth in 2005 while interest rates remain low.Analysts said that economic conditions were benign and Irish shares were still trading at a discount to other European markets.Allied Irish Banks, Ireland's biggest company by capitalisation, touched a five year peak while Bank of Ireland shares rose to their highest level since August 2002"
Japanese banking battle at an end,"Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Financial has withdrawn its takeover offer for rival bank UFJ Holdings, enabling the latter to merge with Mitsubishi Tokyo.Sumitomo, Japan's third-largest bank, tabled a higher offer for UFJ than its rival, valuing the company at $35bn.However, UFJ's management was known to prefer the offer from Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group (MTFG), Japan's second-largest bank.UFJ Holdings, Japan's fourth-largest bank, has been at the centre of a fierce bid battle over the last year.Sumitomo bosses told counterparts at UFJ of its decision on Friday, clearing the way for it to conclude a 3 trillion yen ($29bn) deal with Mitsubishi.Mitsubishi's takeover of UFJ - which will be Japan's largest-ever takeover deal - will still have to be approved by shareholders of the two firms"
Rich grab half Colombia poor fund,"A total of 24.2 trillion pesos ($10.2bn; £5.5bn) is earmarked for subsidies for the poor, the government department for planning said.Sound distribution of the cash could cut poverty levels to 36% from 53%, the government believes.Half of the money put aside by the Colombian government to help the country's poor is benefiting people who do not need it, a study has found.""Resources are more than enough to reduce poverty and there is no need for more tax reforms but a better distribution,"" deputy planning director Jose Leibovich said"
"Rover deal 'may cost 2,000 jobs'","But Rover told BBC News that reports of job cuts were ""speculation"".SAIC was unavailable for comment on the job cuts when contacted by BBC News.Rover and SAIC signed a technology-sharing agreement in August.Some 2,000 jobs at MG Rover's Midlands plant may be cut if investment in the firm by a Chinese car maker goes ahead, the Financial Times has reported.SAIC says none of its money will be paid to the four owners of Rover, who have been accused by unions of awarding themselves exorbitant salaries, the FT reports.Meanwhile, according to Chinese state press reports, small state-owned carmaker Nanjing Auto is in negotiations with Rover and SAIC to take a 20% stake in the joint venture"
Ad firm WPP's profits surge 15%,"WPP in recent years has also bought firms such as Ogilvy & Mather and Cordiant Communications.UK advertising giant WPP has posted larger-than-expected annual profits and predicted that it will outperform the market in 2005.Pre-tax profits rose 15% from a year ago to reach £546m ($1.04bn), ahead of average analysts' forecasts of £532m.During the year WPP bought US rival Grey Global, creating a giant big enough to rival sector leader Omnicom.The long-term outlook looks ""very favourable"" because of media and technology developments and the strength of the US economy, WPP said"
US gives foreign firms extra time,"Many foreign firms had protested that the SEC was imposing an unfair burden.The SEC said it had taken into consideration the fact that foreign companies were already working to meet more onerous financial reporting rules in their home countries.Section 404 of the Sox Act, as the legislation is nicknamed, calls for all firms to certify that their financial reporting is in line with US rules.Foreign firms have been given an extra year to meet tough new corporate governance regulations imposed by the US stock market watchdog.Big US firms already have to meet the requirements, but smaller ones and foreign-based firms which list their shares on US stock markets originally had until the middle of this year.The European Union, in particular, was imposing new international financial reporting standards in 2005, it noted"
Japanese mogul arrested for fraud,"But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies.Mr Tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies.There was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable.Yoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team.His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals.One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.""I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,"" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987.He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo"
Deutsche Telekom sees mobile gain,"A year ago, debt was more than 11bn euros higher.This was more than expected and helped to bring debt down to 35.8bn euros.Sales rose 2.8% to 14.96bn euros.Sales of stakes in firms including Russia's OAO Mobile Telesystems raised 1.17bn euros"
Chinese wine tempts Italy's Illva,"Yantai State Asset Management Bureau - a government agency in the north-eastern city of Yantai - owns 55% of Changyu.The consumption of wine in China is still low, at just 0.22 litres per capita, said the US Agriculture Department.Italy's Illva Saronno has agreed to buy 33% of Changyu, the largest wine maker in China.Chinese wine sales are growing, the US Agriculture Department said, with wine sales in 2003 up 25% at 61.1bn yuan.The Italian liqueur maker will acquire the shares from the Yantai State Asset Management Bureau"
Umbro profits lifted by Euro 2004,"UK sportswear firm Umbro has posted a 222% rise in annual profit after sales of replica England football kits were boosted by the Euro 2004 tournament.Umbro, which recently lost sponsorship deals with Chelsea and Celtic, said on Thursday it had signed a new four-year agreement with Scottish club Rangers.In January, Umbro announced its sponsorship agreement with Chelsea, which gave Umbro the lucrative right to make replica shirts, would end in 2006, five years earlier than expected.The firm, reporting its first annual results since listing on the London Stock Exchange in June, said the UK market had seen sales growth of 8% last year.Chief executive Peter McGuigan said the firm plans to grow sales both in the UK and internationally"
Fed chief warning on US deficit,"Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that allowing huge US budget deficits to continue could have ""severe"" consequences.He also urged Congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the US heading further into the red.While the US economy is growing at a ""reasonably good pace"" he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the US.Meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added.Speaking to the House Budget Committee he urged Congress to take action to cut the deficit, such as increasing taxes.As US growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit"
UK Coal plunges into deeper loss,"UK Coal said it was making ""significant progress"" in shaking up the business.The recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said.The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006.Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule.The company said these actions should ""significantly uplift earnings"".UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham"
Saudi ministry to employ women,"Women will be employed in Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry for the first time this year, Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal has been reported as saying.The newspaper said many Saudi women found his explanation ""a pitiful excuse for not employing women"".""I am proud to mention here that this year we shall have women working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the first time.""""Our educational reforms have created a new generation of highly-educated and professionally trained Saudi women who are acquiring their rightful position in Saudi society,"" Arab News quoted Prince Saud as saying"
Japan economy slides to recession,"Japan's economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005.Japan's economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession.A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, although the Japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy.The Japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade.Gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004.The Tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year.""The economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture, it is in a recovery stage,"" said Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Heizo Takenaka.The fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending, and follows similar falls in GDP in the two previous quarters"
US crude prices surge above $53,"US crude prices have soared to fresh four-month highs above $53 in the US as refinery problems propelled petrol prices to an all-time high.Meanwhile, oil production cartel Opec's recent announcement that it was now unlikely to cut production levels has also failed to calm fears on the market.Elsewhere, a refinery in Houston was closed due to mechanical problems, while on Tuesday production at BP's Texas City refinery was taken down for a short time.The jump followed a fire at Western Refining Company's refinery in Texas, which shut down petrol production.In the approach to Spring, the market becomes much more sensitive to problems with petrol production as dealers anticipate rising demand for fuel ahead of the holiday season.Ed Silliere, analyst at Energy Merchant, added: ""Gasoline is up because of the refinery issues in Texas, which means there will be a scramble for product in the (US) Gulf Coast."
Industrial output falls in Japan,"The economy has grown for six quarters but growth slowed dramatically in the last quarter amid weaker global demand.Japanese industrial output fell in October while unemployment rose, casting further doubt on the strength of the country's economic recovery.Analysts had been forecasting a 0.1% rise in month on month industrial output.According to figures from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the decline was led by a fall in demand for electronic parts for mobile phones and digital televisions.Although inventories fell 0.7% month on month, they were 36% higher than a year ago.Japanese government officials played down the latest data, arguing that domestic consumer demand was still resilient"
Ryanair in $4bn Boeing plane deal,"""With this new order and new pricing in place, Ryanair expects that unit operating costs (excluding fuel) will continue to fall each year for the next five years,"" he added.At the end of this year, Ryanair will have taken delivery of about 100 new planes, while the 70 new orders are due for delivery between 2008 and 2012.Budget airline Ryanair has placed an order for 70 Boeing 737-800 planes, in a deal valued at $4bn (£2.1bn) which should lead to 2,500 new Ryanair jobs.Ryanair said the new planes would help it to cut operating costs further.Ryanair chairman David Bonderman said that the 737-800 had ""significantly reduced our unit operating costs and allowed us to reduce air fares each year for the last five years"""
Parmalat to return to stockmarket,"The plan is likely to give creditors of Parmalat Finanziaria shares worth about 5.7% of the debts they are owed.Creditors of Parmalat, the main operating company, are likely to see the percentage of debt they receive fall from 7.3% to 6.9%.As part of the re-listing on the Italian stock exchange, creditors' debts are expected to be converted into shares through two new share issues amounting to more than 2bn euros.In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Parmalat Finanziaria detailed administrators' latest plans for re-listing the shares of the group.Parmalat, the Italian dairy company which went bust after an accounting scandal, hopes to be back on the Italian stock exchange in July"
BMW cash to fuel Mini production,"Less than four years after the new Mini was launched, German car maker BMW has announced £100m of new investment.Last year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini.Initially, BMW said it would produce 100,000 Mini models a year at its vast Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again.When it was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than £10,000.These days, buyers will have to fork out almost £11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to £17,730.The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to £15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list.Last year, MG Rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge.The Mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars.BMW's Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for £10 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium.""Our decision to produce a new Mini was not received well right away,"" said Norbert Reithofer, a member of the BMW management board.In 1999, when BMW still owned Rover, the Oxford factory was producing the award-winning Rover 75.Before Wednesday's announcement, BMW had invested some £280m in Mini production"
Bad weather hits Nestle sales,"As well as increasing its dividend, Nestle plans to buy back shares worth 1bn Swiss francs ($861m; £451m).Nestle said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the US dollar, the disposal of businesses and challenging trading conditions in Europe all dented sales.Uncertainty remains over the future of Perrier, the iconic French mineral water owned by Nestle.Nestle is to raise its dividend by 11% after paying back some of its debt.Revenue dipped 1.4% to 86.7bn Swiss francs ($74.6bn; £39.1bn) in 2004 as sales of ice cream and mineral water were dampened by the wet summer.Elsewhere, Nestle said it had enjoyed an ""exceptional"" year in North America, outperforming the market in terms of sales growth"
Fiat mulls Ferrari market listing,"It said Fiat was set to restructure its business after reaching a $2bn (1.53bn euros; £1.05bn) settlement with GM about Fiat's ownership.That sale valued Ferrari - which owns the Maserati brand - at 2.3bn euros.Steps being considered include listing Ferrari and bringing Maserati and Alfa Romeo closer together, it said.The Financial Times said Fiat may transfer Maserati within its wholly- owned Alfa Romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies.Analysts said the reported restructuring was evidence of the greater flexibility which Fiat now had to develop the business.Maserati and Ferrari sell about 10,000 cars between them and both companies broke even in 2003.Fiat owns a 56% stake in Ferrari -best known for its dominant Formula One motor racing team - having first bought into the business in 1969"
Italy to get economic action plan,"The government says that it has set about tackling the problems, adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of Italy's 60 million population.Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of Italy's economy.According to Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy's business newspaper, the government will focus on ""opening up markets, infrastructure, research, making more incentives available, bankruptcy law, the slow pace of the justice system"".At the same time, bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts, a situation that is hampering Italy's entrepreneurial spirit.Without a pick up in national growth, they say, the money could eventually run out, bringing Italy's economy to a juddering halt.Mr Berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by 6.5bn euros ($8.6bn; £4.5bn) this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend.Mr Berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (R&D) spending, and the competitiveness of small firms.At the same time, business and consumer confidence has dipped and analysts have raised concerns that what little spending there is stems from Italians dipping into their savings accounts or using credit cards.Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the country's sputtering economy on Thursday night in Rome"
Weak dollar hits Reuters,"Reuters beat profit forecasts, posting a 52% rise in profits for the year to £198m from the £130m seen a year earlier.Reuters also managed to slow a decline in underlying revenues to 5.4% from 10.2% in 2003 and cut its debt back to £160m from £610m a year earlier.The news and financial data seller said the year had begun well, adding it expected ""further gradual improvement"" in the second quarter of the year after good January sales.It added it was planning to deliver a further £105m of savings over the coming year - but said it expects to be hit with an £80m restructuring charge to pay for the cost of moving from Fleet Street to new headquarters in London at Canary Wharf"
Hyundai to build new India plant,"The company didn't give details of its investment but it said the new plant would produce 150,000 cars a year.South Korea's Hyundai Motor has announced that it plans to build a second plant in India to meet the country's growing demand for cars.South Korea's top car maker estimates that the Indian market will grow 15% this year, to 920,000 vehicles, reaching 1.6 million vehicles by 2010.Hyundai expects its sales in India to grow 16% to 250,000 in 2005.Demand in India has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said"
SA unveils 'more for all' budget,"The South African government has put tax cuts and increased social spending at the centre of its latest budget.Unveiling the 418bn-rand budget to parliament, Mr Manuel said the South African economy had grown by an average of 3.2% over the past four years, slightly below the African average of 4%.""In this budget, the focus is on more for all, not more for some, and not a hell of a lot more for a few, but spread across all of South Africa,"" said Mr Manuel.Aiming to both stir economic growth and aid the country's poor, finance minister Trevor Manuel said the focus of the 2005 budget was ""more for all"".Given that both corporate and personal taxes are being cut - under the new measures, those earning less than 35,000 rand a year will be exempt from income tax - the extra 22.3bn rand in social spending will be partly met by higher fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes.Economist Colen Garrow said the budget looked as if it would stimulate economic growth"
BMW drives record sales in Asia,"BMW has forecast sales growth of at least 10% in Asia this year after registering record sales there in 2004.The luxury carmaker saw strong sales of its three marques - BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce - in Asia last year after the launch of three new models.China remains the main area of concern for BMW after sales there fell 16% last year.BMW sold nearly 95,000 cars in Asia last year, up 2.6% on 2003.The German carmaker is aiming to boost annual sales in Asia to 150,000 by 2008.BMW sold more than 100 of the iconic models compared with just ten the previous year"
Economy 'stronger than forecast',"""The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,"" Ms Lomax said.""Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,"" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.Private sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said.""This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,"" Ms Lomax said.The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said.Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions.The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information"
Electrolux to export Europe jobs,"The Newton Aycliffe plant could also be affected by Electrolux's separate announcement that it is to spin-off its outdoor products unit into a new separate company.Electrolux saw its shares rise 14% on Tuesday after it said it would be shifting more of its manufacturing to low-cost countries.The Swedish firm, the world's largest maker of home appliances, said it is to relocate about 10 of its 27 plants in western Europe and North America.The company said it was speeding up its restructuring programme, which aims to save between £190m and £265m annually from 2009.""We see that about half the plants in high-cost countries - that is around 10 - are at risk,"" said Electrolux chief executive Hans Straberg"
Worldcom ex-boss launches defence,"The prosecution's star witness, former WorldCom financial chief Scott Sullivan, has said that Mr Ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm, telling him to ""hit our books"".However, Ms Cooper said Mr Sullivan had not mentioned ""anything uncomfortable"" about WorldCom's accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting.Mr Ebber's lawyers have said he was unaware of the fraud, arguing that auditors did not alert him to any problems.Mr Ebbers has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy.Ms Cooper also said that during shareholder meetings Mr Ebbers often passed over technical questions to the company's finance chief, giving only ""brief"" answers himself.Prosecution lawyers have argued that Mr Ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at WorldCom, ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet Wall Street earnings estimates"
Insurance bosses plead guilty,A Marsh spokeswoman said Mr Bewlay was no longer with the company.The highest ranking executive pleading guilty on Tuesday was former Marsh senior vice president Joshua Bewlay.Another three US insurance executives have pleaded guilty to fraud charges stemming from an ongoing investigation into industry malpractice.Mr Spitzer's investigation of the US insurance industry looked at whether companies rigged bids and fixed prices
Further rise in UK jobless total,"The number of people out of work rose 32,000 to 1.41 million in the last three months of 2004, even as 90,000 more people were in employment.Throughout 2004, the number of people in work increased by 296,000 to 28.52 million - the highest figure since records began in 1971.But, despite more people being in work, the manufacturing sector continued to suffer, with 104,000 workers axed during the last quarter of 2004 - pushing employment in the sector to a record low of 3.24 million by the end of last year.The UK's jobless total rose for the second month in a row in December, official figures show"
Wembley firm won't make a profit,"To recoup any profit from Wembley, where the firm changed its steel contractor due to a legal dispute, Multiplex will have to win legal claims against subcontractors.It cut A$68m from profit targets for Wembley and another UK project.Shares in Multiplex Group, which is building the new Wembley stadium, fell as much as 19% after it said it would not make any money on the project.The decline came despite Multiplex reporting an 11% rise in pre-tax profits to A$67.7m for 2004 and reaffirming its 2005 profit forecasts.""It is expected that profits will be possible in future periods as the claims are finalised.""Any profits would depend on the outcome of legal cases resulting from a change in steel contractor, it added"
Cars pull down US retail figures,"Excluding the car sector, US retail sales were up 0.6% in January, twice what some analysts had been expecting.Excluding the car sector, sales rose by just 0.3%.In December, overall retail sales rose by 1.1%.US retail sales fell 0.3% in January, the biggest monthly decline since last August, driven down by a heavy fall in car sales.The 3.3% fall in car sales had been expected, coming after December's 4% rise in car sales, fuelled by generous pre-Christmas special offers.US retail spending is expected to rise in 2005, but not as quickly as in 2004"
Lufthansa may sue over Bush visit,"German airline Lufthansa may sue federal agencies for damages after the arrival of US president George W Bush disrupted flights.Central to the problem was that instead of half an hour, the arrival of President Bush on the German leg of his European tour took the best part of an hour, Lufthansa said.Despite the problems, Mr Lamberty said that it was not certain that Lufthansa would take legal action.Mr Lamberty said that 92 outgoing flights and 86 income flights were delayed by an average of an hour following President Bush's arrival, affecting almost 17,000 passengers.Lufthansa said that it may lose millions of euros as a result of Air Force One landing at Frankfurt airport.Mr Lamberty explained that the company did not plan to pursue Germany's air traffic controllers' organisation or the airport authority but wanted instead to see if it was possible to sue the German federal agencies that gave the orders"
EU aiming to fuel development aid,"Any tax would only be implemented after full consultation with the airlines, the EU said.It added that any plan to levy taxes on jet fuel ""should not hinder the competitiveness of the airlines and that they themselves will not be solely funding development"".said Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, secretary general of the Association of European Airlines.European Union finance ministers meet on Thursday to discuss proposals, including a tax on jet fuel, to boost development aid for poorer nations.At present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in EU member states.Airlines have reacted strongly against the proposed fuel levy.There is thought to be widespread support for the plan - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting of the world's richest nations - from EU ministers"
German business confidence slides,"Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank.Munich-based research institute Ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in February from 97.5 in January, its first decline in three months.Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish.Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February's Ifo confidence figure ""a very mild decline"".German business confidence fell in February knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in Europe's largest economy.""We're surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock,"" said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner"
FAO warns on impact of subsidies,"The FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries' access to the world market.The market situation has divided developing nations in two groups, the FAO said.Trade barriers and subsidies ""severely"" distort the market, the FAO report on the ""State of Agricultural Commodity Markets 2004"" said.It recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation.For 43 developing countries, more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product.According to the organisation, subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice"
India seeks to boost construction,"He said, ""No country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone.""India has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in its construction sector.The government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the 'automatic route' in the construction sector, on projects including housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals and educational establishments.Mr Nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired.Mr Majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.Analysts say improving India's infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too.Previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the Indian market"
Boeing unveils new 777 aircraft,"Both Boeing and Airbus have been taking orders for their new planes.Boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200LR planes over the next 20 years.""Airbus is now where Boeing was a few years ago"" with its product range, said Flight International's Mr Learmount.US aircraft firm Boeing has unveiled its new long-distance 777 plane, as it tries to regain its position as the industry's leading manufacturer.Boeing, in contrast to European rival Airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances.It is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777-200LR and its much-anticipated 787 Dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008.""Boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful,"" said David Learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International.Boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world's airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights.He also said that while the plane may be able to fly to Sydney from London in one hit, prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.Analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between Boeing and Airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry"
Circuit City gets takeover offer,"Bill Armstrong, a retail analyst at CL King & Associates, said he expected to see other private investment firms come forward for Circuit City.The bid has come from Boston-based private investment firm Highfields Capital Management, which already owns 6.7% of Circuit City's shares.Highfield said that it intends to take the Virginia-based firm private.""Such a transformation would eliminate the public-company transparency into the company's operating strategy that is uniquely damaging in a highly competitive industry where Circuit City is going head-to-head with a tough and entrenched rival,"" Highfield said"
Japan turns to beer alternatives,"Asahi is predicting profits to rise 50% in 2005 as it launches a drink based on soybean peptides rather than malt.Japanese brewers are increasingly making money from beer-flavoured drinks rather than beer itself  Beer and spirits are heavily taxed in Japan, driving breweries to search for alternatives.Now, according to Asahi Breweries, the market for so-called ""beer-like"" drinks is set to grow 84% this year.But despite a record profit in 2004 of 30.6bn yen ($291m; £154m), up 31.8% on the previous year, Asahi is coming late to the market"
S Korean consumers spending again,"The country's economy has suffered from an overhang of personal debt after its consumers' credit card spending spree.The government last year tightened the rules for card lending to keep the card glut under control.Credit card debt is falling, with only one in 13 of the 48 million cards now in default - down from one in eight at the end of 2003.One of its biggest card issuers, LG Card, was rescued from collapse in December, having almost imploded under the weight of its customers' bad debts.Economic growth in 2004 was about 4.7%, with the central bank predicting 4% growth this year.Card use fell sharply last year, but is now picking up again with a rise in spending of 14.8% year-on-year"
German growth goes into reverse,"The figures confounded hopes of a 0.2% expansion in the fourth quarter in Europe's biggest economy.Germany's economy shrank 0.2% in the last three months of 2004, upsetting hopes of a sustained recovery.The ECB's mandate is to fight rising prices by boosting interest rates - and that could further threaten Germany's hopes of recovery.It said growth in the third quarter had been zero, putting the economy at a standstill from July onward.Germany has been reliant on exports to get its economy back on track, as unemployment of more than five million and impending cuts to welfare mean German consumers have kept their money to themselves"
Turkey-Iran mobile deal 'at risk',"Turkcell's mobile deal is the second Turkish investment in Iran to run into trouble.The company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if Iran will award it the mobile deal.Turkey's investment in Iran's mobile industry looks set to be scrapped after its biggest mobile firm saw its investment there slashed by MPs.Although the company's statement said it would continue to monitor developments, observers said they thought Turkcell was set to pull out of the $3bn deal.Iran's parliament voted by a large majority to cut Turkcell's stake in a new mobile network from 70% to 49%"
EU ministers to mull jet fuel tax,"European Union finance ministers are meeting on Thursday in Brussels, where they are to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax.Many EU ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting.It was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the ""competitiveness of the airlines"".The EU said a tax would only be passed after full consultation with airlines"
Palestinian economy in decline,"Despite a short-lived increase in Palestinian jobs in 2003, the economy is performing well below its potential, said a World Bank report.According to the report, Intifada, Closures and Palestinian Economic Crisis: An Assessment, there is a close link between the number of closures - both border closures and internal closures between cities - and Palestinian economic problems.However, during the first half of this year, the Palestinian economy lost more than 22,000 jobs.The report said even more would be on the poverty line without an average of $950m a year from international donors, some of which goes towards job creation.Young people are particularly hard hit with 37% out of work, compared with 14% four years ago.But 104,000 new jobs were created last year during a brief easing of violence and closures"
China had role in Yukos split-up,"The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China.""The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,"" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan.The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks.The deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy.The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China's CNPC.Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead.China lent Russia $6bn (£3.2bn) to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos, it has been revealed.But Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft.Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines"
Deadline nears for Fiat-GM deal,"Since then, however, Fiat cars have lost market share and the firm has piled up losses, while a plan to raise new money in 2003 cut GM's stake in half to 10%.The German firm wanted to buy Fiat outright.The deadline marks the point at which Fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to GM, part of an alliance agreed in 2000.The 2000 deal resulted from a race between GM and DaimlerChrysler to ally with Fiat.GM, whose own European operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable Fiat unit"
ID theft surge hits US consumers,"The biggest slice of the 246,570 ID fraud cases reported - almost 30% - concerned abuses of people's credit.The total cost of fraud reported by consumers was $546m (£290m).Internet auctions were the second biggest source of fraud complaints, comprising 16% of the total.The Federal Trade Commission said two in five of the 635,173 reports it had from consumers concerned ID fraud.Catalogue and home-shopping frauds were next in line, accounting for 8% of total complaints, while concerns about internet services and computers - including spyware found on people's PCs and undisclosed charges for websites - amounted to 6% of complaints"
"Argentina, Venezuela in oil deal","Argentine President Nestor Kirchner and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez signed the deal in Buenos Aires on Tuesday.Argentina and Venezuela have extended a food-for-oil deal, which helped the former to overcome a severe energy crisis last year.Last April, Argentina signed a $240m agreement to import Venezuelan fuel in exchange for agricultural goods and this deal has now been extended.President Chavez added that Brazil's Petrobras could join soon the co-operation deal.The two countries also formalised a co-operation deal between Venezuelan energy firm PDVSA and Argentina's Enarsa"
BMW to recall faulty diesel cars,"BMW is to recall all cars equipped with a faulty diesel fuel-injection pump supplied by parts maker Robert Bosch.The German company is to extend a planned production break at one of its plants due to the faulty Bosch part.The faulty part does not represent a safety risk and the recall only affects pumps made in December and January.Audi said it had been hit by production bottlenecks, due to a shortage of unaffected Bosch parts.A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, parent company of Mercedes Benz, said it will however have to halt some production.Audi and Mercedes Benz were also supplied with the defective diesel fuel-injection pumps but neither of them have to recall any vehicles"
Takeover rumour lifts Exel shares,"Andrew Beh, of brokers ING, said UPS and Deutsche Post were the most likely bidders and an offer of 950p a share would be fair if a bidding battle did not break out.The talk in the City is that US giant United Parcel Services (UPS) is the most likely bidder for the firm.Yet other names mentioned in connection to buying Exel are DHL-owner Deutsche Post and finance firm GE Capital.Shares in storage and delivery firm Exel closed up 9% at a two-and-a-half year high on Tuesday on speculation it is to receive an imminent takeover bid"
Yukos accused of lying to court,"Russian oil firm Yukos lied to a US court in an attempt to stop the Russian government selling off its key production unit, the court has heard.Yukos argued that since it had a US subsidiary and local bank accounts, the US court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of Yugansk.But Deutsche Bank - itself a target of a Yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case.Analysts have questioned whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies, while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos' legal wrangling as meaningless.Its lawyer, Hugh Ray, told the court that Yukos had claimed it had transferred $27m into two Texas bank accounts opened by its new US subsidiary.Yukos chief financial officer Bruce Misamore, who had moved to the US in early December to set up Yukos USA, acknowledged the point.Deutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos.Yukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the US because it feared it would not be able to do so in Russia.It had agreed to loan to an arm of Russian state gas firm Gazprom the money to bid for Yuganskneftegaz, as the Yukos unit is formally known.By doing so, he said, the firm had intended to reinforce its US presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in US courts"
Mexican in US send $16bn home,"Last year, there were 50.9 million transactions, with an average value of $327 per remittance, the bank said.The Bank of Mexico said that remittances grew 24% last year and now represent the country's second-biggest source of income after oil.Remittance charges are estimated to have dropped by between 50 and 60%, reports from the US Treasury and the Inter-American Development Bank have said.The Inter-American Development Bank estimates that remittances to Latin America and the Caribbean reached $45bn in 2004.Mexican labourers living in the US sent a record $16.6bn (£8.82bn) home last year"
Home loan approvals rising again,"Mortgage lending rose by £7.1bn in December, up from a £6.4bn rise in November.Changes to mortgage regulation may have artificially depressed figures in November, thus flattering the December figures, analysts said.""The modest rise in mortgage approvals and lending in December reinforces the impression that the housing market is currently slowing steadily rather than sharply,"" said Global Insight analyst Howard Archer, commenting on the BoE's figures.Separately, the Bank of England said that consumer credit rose by £1.5bn in December, more than the £1.4bn expected and above the £1.4bn reported in the previous month"
Manufacturing recovery 'slowing',"The survey is more upbeat than official figures - which suggest that manufacturing is in recession - but analysts said the survey did suggest that the manufacturing recovery was running out of steam.The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) said its purchasing manager index (PMI) fell to 51.8 from a revised 53.3 in December.UK manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in one-and-a-half years in January, according to a survey.The CIPS said that the strong pound had dented exports while rising oil and metals prices had kept costs high"
Worldcom boss 'left books alone',"During cross examination, he asked Mr Myers if he ever knew Mr Ebbers ""make an accounting decision?"".""Not that I am aware of,"" Mr Myers replied.""Did you ever know Mr Ebbers to make an accounting entry into Worldcom books?""Mr Myers has admitted that he ordered false accounting entries at the request of former Worldcom chief financial officer Scott Sullivan.David Myers made the comments under questioning by defence lawyers who have been arguing that Mr Ebbers was not responsible for Worldcom's problems.Defence lawyers have been trying to paint Mr Sullivan, who has admitted fraud and will testify later in the trial, as the mastermind behind Worldcom's accounting house of cards.Mr Myers has already pleaded guilty to fraud and is assisting prosecutors.Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers, who is accused of overseeing an $11bn (£5.8bn) fraud, never made accounting decisions, a witness has told jurors"
Metlife buys up Citigroup insurer,"US banking giant Citigroup has sold its Travelers Life & Annuity insurance arm to Metlife for $11.5bn (£6.1bn).The company will pay between $1bn and $3bn in Metlife stock with the rest being made up of cash.Travelers had sales of $5.2bn in 2004 and made a profit of $901m.For Metlife, the US's leading insurance company, the purchase gives it access to a much larger distribution network.It has total net assets of $96bn"
Europe blames US over weak dollar,"The comments come a day after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was ""in America's interest"".US officials were talking up the dollar, they said, but failing to take action to back up their words.But analysts said the respite was likely to be only temporary.Nicolas Sarkozy of France said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit Europe's economies by eating into their exports.At 0619 GMT on Tuesday, the dollar was up slightly at just above $1.29 to the euro, and buying 105.6 yen in Tokyo.Meeting in Brussels, finance ministers of the 12 eurozone countries voiced their concern that the rise of the european currency was harming exports.European leaders have openly blamed the US for the sharp rise in the value of the euro.The European ministers' comments, said Junya Tanase of JPMorgan Chase bank in Tokyo, were ""generally too weak to produce a market reaction"""
French wine gets 70m euro top-up,"The French government is to hand its struggling wine industry 70m euros ($91m) in aid to help it battle falling sales and damaging overproduction.The support is designed to make French producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across the wine industry.The French wine industry, the world's second largest, has been hit by declining consumption at home and the growing popularity of New World wines.Efforts to promote French wine abroad are to be boosted by an extra 3.5m euros in funding.A further 15m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives, which make up the majority of French producers, in low interest loans.However, wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for.The government will also seek European Union approval to distil about 250 million litres of excess wine into alcohol, with vintners receiving compensation.Wine makers, however, claimed the support did not go far enough"
Russia gets investment blessing,"""These improvements are so significant that they now outweight the serious and growing political risk that continues to be a key ratings constraint on Russia,"" wrote S&P credit analyst Helena Hessel.Instead, with Russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales, S&P said the government's own debt is looking a good bet.Soaring oil sales and a budget surplus mean Russian debt is no longer a risky investment, one of the world's leading credit rating agencies says.The other two major ratings agencies - Fitch and Moody's have long since upped their rating of Russia's sovereign debt.But the agency made it clear that the improved rating did not mean that the risks were a thing of the past.S&P said the solidity of government finances outweighed the risk.Standard & Poor's has classed Russian bonds as ""investment grade"", up from their former ""speculative"" rating"
Iranian MPs threaten mobile deal,"Conservatives in parliament say Turkcell's stake in Irancell, the new network, should be cut from 70% to 49%.Turkcell signed a contract for the new network in September.Iran currently has only one heavily congested mobile network, with long waiting lists for new subscribers.They say that Turkcell is a security risk because of alleged business ties with Israel.Turkcell said the ruling would ""make more difficult... Turkcell's financial consolidation of Irancell"" because its stake would be reduced to less than 50%.The firm has refused to comment on whether it has business dealings in Israel, although like almost all GSM operators worldwide it has an interconnection deal with Israeli networks so that its customers can use their phones there.Turkcell now says it may give up on the deal altogether.Telecoms is one of two areas specifically targeted by the new veto law on foreign investments, passed earlier in September"
Argentina closes $102.6bn debt swap,"Argentina is set to close its $102.6bn (£53.51bn) debt restructuring offer for bondholders later on Friday, with the government hopeful that most creditors will accept the deal.By 18 February, creditors holding $41bn - or 40% of the total debt - had accepted the offer.The country has been in default on the $102.6bn - based on an original debt of $81.8bn plus interest - for the past three years.About 70% to 80% of bondholders are expected to accept the terms of the offer.Argentina defaulted on its debt three years ago, the biggest sovereign default in modern history.The estimated loss to bondholders is up to 70% of the original value of the bonds, yet the majority are expected to accept the government's offer"
US economy shows solid GDP growth,"Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years.In the final quarter of 2004, businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18%, up from 17.5% in the third quarter.In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast.The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004"
Profits slide at India's Dr Reddy,"Sales in Dr Reddy's generics business fell 8.6% to 966m rupees.Profits at Indian drugmaker Dr Reddy's fell 93% as research costs rose and sales flagged.Dr Reddy's has built its reputation on producing generic versions of big-name pharmaceutical products.The firm said its profits were 40m rupees ($915,000; £486,000) for the three months to December on sales which fell 8% to 4.7bn rupees.Dr Reddy's Indian competitors are gathering strength although they too face heavy competitive pressures"
Burren awarded Egyptian contracts,"British energy firm Burren Energy has been awarded two potentially lucrative oil exploration contracts in Egypt.Burren Energy already has a presence in Egypt, having been awarded an exploration contract last year.The £13.8m deal gives Burren Energy access to the Indian oil and gas industry"
'Strong dollar' call halts slide,"The US dollar's slide against the euro and yen has halted after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was ""in America's interest"".Higher growth in Europe is regarded by US officials as a way the huge US current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced.US officials have also said that other economies need to grow, so the US is not the main global growth engine.The dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100GMT, still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 November.Some analysts maintain the US is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in Europe, thus boosting its economy.But analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the US economy were still significant.A weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit.When a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners,"" he said.Economists say that the fundamentals, or key indicators, of the US economy are looking far from rosy.Mr Snow's comments may have helped shore up the dollar on Monday, but he was careful to qualify his statement"
IMF 'cuts' German growth estimate,"The IMF will also reduce its growth estimate for the 12-member eurozone economy from 2.2% to 1.6%, the newspaper reported.The IMF's draft World Economic Outlook - due to be published in April - would point to a marked deterioration in Germany's economy, the FT report said.In September, the IMF had said that German growth for the current year would be 1.8%.The IMF has also revised eurozone forecasts, the paper said, taking into account high oil prices, the strength of the euro and weak demand in many of the world's leading economies"
"GM, Ford cut output as sales fall","US sales at GM sank 12.7% in February compared to a year ago while Ford sales dropped 3% as foreign rivals took a bigger share of the market.In 2003, the firm launched an ambitious plan to triple US sales by 2007 as it seeks to become a bigger player in the Asian assault on the US market.Chrysler, the US unit of Germany's DaimlerChrysler, was the only Detroit based automaker to boast an increase in market share during the month - with sales rising 8%.GM added that US truck sales fell 9% in February while car business tumbled 17%, however it did acknowledge that some new products - such as the Pontiac G6 and Chevrolet Cobalt - had put in solid performances.While Japan's top car maker Toyota and Nissan saw sales accelerate, even the smaller Suzuki Motor Corp snapped up a more business with sales improving 17.6% on a year ago.US car firms General Motors (GM) and Ford have been forced to cut production in the face of falling car sales.Meanwhile, Ford which posted its ninth consecutive drop in monthly US sales, said it was cutting first-quarter North American production by another 10,000 vehicles, or 1.2%"
Ebbers denies WorldCom fraud,"Mr Ebbers relationship to Mr Sullivan is key to the case surrounding financial corruption that led to the collapse of the firm in 2002 following the discovery of an $11bn accounting fraud.During his time on the witness stand Mr Sullivan repeatedly told jurors he met frequently with Mr Ebbers, told him about changes made to WorldCom's accounts to hide costs and had warned him such practises were improper.Mr Ebbers has denied charges of fraud and conspiracy.During his second day of questioning in the New York trial Mr Ebbers played down his working relationship with Mr Sullivan and denied he frequently met him to discuss company business when questioned by the prosecution.However during the case on Tuesday Mr Ebbers denied the allegations.Speaking in court, Mr Ebbers rejected allegations he pressured ex-chief financial officer Scott Sullivan to falsify company financial statements.Mr Sullivan ""made accounting decisions,"" he told the federal court, saying his finance chief had ""a keen command of the numbers"""
Australia rates at four year high,"The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%, their first upwards move in more than a year.However, opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis.""That 1.5% annual growth rate is the lowest we have seen since the post-election slump we saw back in 2000-1,"" said Michael Blythe, chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts.The Australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low.Australia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the country's economy.Stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy"
US company admits Benin bribery,"A US defence and telecommunications company has agreed to pay $28.5m after admitting bribery in the West African state of Benin.The Titan corporation was accused of funnelling more than $2m into the 2001 re-election campaign of President Mathieu Kerekou.The SEC had accused Titan of illegally paying $2.1m to an unnamed agent in Benin claiming ties with President Kerekou.At the time, Titan was trying to get a higher price for a telecommunications project in Benin.Titan, a California-based company, pleaded guilty to falsifying its accounts and violating US anti-bribery laws"
"US insurer Marsh cuts 2,500 jobs","""Clearly 2004 was the most difficult year in MMC's financial history,"" Marsh chief executive Michael Cherkasky said.Marsh did not say when the move would take place, but said it had signed a letter of intent.An ongoing restructuring drive at the group also led to a $337m hit in the fourth quarter, the world's biggest insurer said.The insurer said the cuts were part of a cost-cutting drive, aimed at saving millions of dollars.In an effort to reform its business practises, Marsh said it has already introduced new leadership, new compliance procedures and new ways of dealing with customers.As part of its efforts to cut costs, the company said it was halving its dividend payment to 17 cents a shares from 34 cents, a move which should enable it to save $360m.Under the settlement announced in January, Marsh took a pre-tax charge of $618m in the October-to-December quarter, on top of the $232m charge from the previous quarter.Marsh posted a $676m (£352m) loss for the last three months of 2004, against a $375m (£195.3m) profit a year before"
US seeks new $280bn smoker ruling,"Government lawyers said they would ask the full US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to hear the case.Prosecutors contend that executives from the major tobacco firms met and agreed to present a unified strategy denying the harmful effects of smoking.The court room battle is seen as key in government attempts to fight smoking.Prosecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking, ignored research that highlighted problems, looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts.Government lawyers have until 21 March to file their appeal.The US Justice Department is to try to overturn a court ruling that threw out its claim for $280bn (£149bn) in damages from tobacco firms.The tobacco companies denied the charges, saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public"
Budget Aston takes on Porsche,"The Vantage is ""the most important car in the history of our company"", said Aston's chief executive Ulrich Bez.Development costs for the Vantage have been kept low by sharing a platform with Aston's DB9, which Mr Bez described as ""the previous most important car for our company"".Mr Bez - himself a former executive at rival Porsche - said the new car was the company's ""most affordable car ever and makes the brand accessible"".Aston - whose cars were famously used by James Bond - will unveil the Vantage at the Geneva Motor Show on Thursday"
Golden rule 'intact' says ex-aide,"Mr Balls rejected the allegation that Mr Brown had been sidelined in the election campaign, saying he was playing a ""different"" role to the one he played in the last two elections.""I don't believe it would be a big election issue in Britain or a problem for Labour,"" Mr Balls said.Any rate rise ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning, he added.Commenting on speculation of an interest rate rise, he said it was not within the remit of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to factor a potential election into its rate decisions.Gordon Brown's decision to announce the date of the Budget while on a trip to China was a ""sensible thing to do"", since he was talking about skills and investment at the time, Mr Balls told the BBC.Formerly one of Mr Brown's closest Treasury aides, Ed Balls hinted at a Budget giveaway on 16 March"
Liberian economy starts to grow,"""The IMF team stands ready to assist the (Liberian) authorities in strengthening the areas mentioned,"" said the report.These matters are now being investigated by the Liberian authorities and the IMF has called for their findings to be made public.The Liberian economy started to grow in 2004, but ""sustained and deep reform efforts"" are needed to ensure long term growth, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.An IMF mission made the comments in a report published following 10 days of talks with the transition government.The IMF said that, according to data provided by the Liberians, the country's GDP rose by 2% in 2004, after a 31% decline in 2003"
Slowdown hits US factory growth,"""February was another good month in the manufacturing sector,"" said ISM survey chairman Norbert Ore.  ""While the overall rate of growth is slowing, the overall picture is improving as price increases and shortages are becoming less of a problem.Although the index was lower than in January, the fact that it held above 50 shows continued growth in the sector.Of the 20 manufacturing sectors surveyed by ISM, 13 reported growth.The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) index fell to 55.3 in February, from an adjusted 56.4 in January"
Lufthansa flies back to profit,"German airline Lufthansa has returned to profit in 2004 after posting huge losses in 2003.The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share.In a preliminary report, the airline announced net profits of 400m euros ($527.61m; £274.73m), compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003.Last year, Lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy"
Japanese growth grinds to a halt,"The growth falls well short of expectations, but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion.The first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%, with the second showing 1.1%, and economists had been predicting as much as 2% this time around.The effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery.The economy had stagnated throughout the 1990s, experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums.Growth in Japan evaporated in the three months to September, sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough.But high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the growth rate, while the falling dollar means products shipped to the US are becoming relatively more expensive"
Unilever shake up as profit slips,"The company also said it planned to spend 500m euros this year buying back shares.Sales of ice cream and frozen food dipped by 3.4% In the US last year, revenue grew by 1.5% ""despite disappointing sales in Slimfast"", the company said.Unilever said European sales fell 2.8% last year, dragged down by below part sales at its beverage division, where revenues dipped by almost 4%.The company said the organizational changes would speed decision making, and it also may make further changes.Unilever, which owns brands including Dove soap, said annual pre-tax profit fell 36% to 2.9bn euros (£1.99bn).But looking ahead, Unilever said it was optimistic about prospects for its slimming products saying that demand is on the wane for rival low-carbohydrate diets.""While it is certainly the case that markets have been tougher in the past eighteen months than we had expected, we have also lost some market share,"" said Mr Cescau.The company also cited difficult trading conditions and a lack of demand for goods such as its Slimfast range.""The best part of the news this morning was that the company announced a structure simplification,"" said Arjan Sweere, an analyst at Petercam.Unilever took a 1.5bn euro one-time charge in the fourth quarter, including a 650m euro write-down on Slimfast diet foods"
France Telecom gets Orange boost,"France Telecom, one of the world's largest telecoms and internet service providers, saw its full-year sales rise 2.2% to 47.2bn euros in 2004.Increased take-up of broadband telecoms services also boosted France Telecom's profits, which showed a 5.5% rise to 18.3bn euros ($23.4bn; £12.5bn).France Telecom is to spend 578m euros on buying out minority shareholders in data services provider Equant.France Telecom is consolidating its interest in Equant, which provides telecoms and data services to businesses.An ill-fated expansion drive in the late 1990s saw France Telecom's debt soar to 72bn euros by 2002.Strong growth in subscriptions to mobile phone network Orange has helped boost profits at owner France Telecom"
Brussels raps mobile call charges,"Vodafone and O2, Britain's other big mobile phone operator, were sent similar statements of objections by the Commission in July last year.The European Commission has written to the mobile phone operators Vodafone and T-Mobile to challenge ""the high rates"" they charge for international roaming.The Commission's investigation into Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile centres on the tariffs the two companies charge foreign mobile operators to access their networks when subscribers of those foreign operators use their mobile phones in Germany.""The Commission aims to ensure that European consumers are not overcharged when they use their mobile phones on their travels around the European Union,"" the Commission said in a statement.Vodafone sent the Commission a response to those allegations in December last year and is now waiting for a reply.In letters sent to the two companies, the Commission alleged the firms were abusing their dominant market position in the German mobile phone market.The Vodafone spokesman said a similar process would be set in motion with these latest statement of objections about its operations in Germany"
WorldCom director admits lying,"Mr Sullivan, 42, has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following Mr Ebbers' trial, where he is appearing as a prosecution witness.Mr Sullivan claims that Mr Ebbers refused to stop the fraud.Mr Weingarten has suggested that Mr Sullivan is implicating Mr Ebbers only to win a lighter sentence, something Mr Sullivan denies.Mr Sullivan also rejects a suggestion that he had once told fellow WorldCom board member Bert Roberts that Mr Ebbers was unaware of the accounting fraud at WorldCom.Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom's collapse in 2002.The trial of Mr Ebbers is now into its third week.In the New York court on Wednesday, Mr Ebbers' lawyer Reid Weingarten asked Mr Sullivan: ""If you believe something is in your interest, you are willing and able to lie to accomplish it, isn't that right?""Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom's finances"
Glaxo aims high after profit fall,"Mr Garnier said the company had absorbed over £1.5bn of lost sales to generics but still managing to grow the business.Chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier said it had been a ""difficult year"".""2005 will also be an important year in terms of research and development pipeline progress.""However, the firm discontinued development of an experimental treatment for obesity, known as '771, after disappointing clinical trial results"
Japan bank shares up on link talk,"Shares of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial (SMFG), and Daiwa Securities jumped amid speculation that two of Japan's biggest financial companies will merge.SMFG President Yoshifumi Nishikawa said that the companies needed to bolster their businesses.Combining SMFG, Japan's third-biggest lender, and Daiwa, the country's second-largest brokerage firm, would create a company with assets of more than $1,000bn (£537bn).SMFG shares climbed by 2.7% to 717,000, and Daiwa added 5.3% to 740 yen.Daiwa said that ""although it is true that the two groups have been engaging in various discussions to enhance cooperation, there are no plans to enter into negotiations to consolidate the two businesses"""
Car giant hit by Mercedes slump,"For the year as a whole, its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros.The US division - whose marques include Dodge and Jeep - transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1.4bn euros profit last year.Mercedes' profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003's 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros.The German-US carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros ($1bn) from 2.4bn euros in 2003.Mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros, having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with German workers last year.A slump in profitability at luxury car maker Mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent DaimlerChrysler.Chrysler's strong performance helped the world's fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros.The carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its Mercedes Smart mini-car range.Sales of Mercedes' brands fell 2% as demand cooled, while revenues were affected by the weakness of the US dollar"
Ericsson sees earnings improve,"For the whole of 2004, Ericsson returned a net profit of 19bn kronor, compared with a loss of 10.8bn kronor in 2003.Operating profit in the three months to 31 December was 9.5bn kronor (£722m; $1.3bn) against 6.3bn kronor last year.However, the company remained optimistic about its earnings outlook after sales in the fourth quarter rose 9% to 39.4bn kronor.Sales climbed to 131.9 billion kronor from 117.7bn kronor in 2003.Ericsson shares dropped 5.9% to 20.7 kronor in early trading on Thursday"
Bank opts to leave rates on hold,"Slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months.Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC ""may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside"".Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears.Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike.The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was ""concerned by the clamour in some quarters"" for early interest rate increases.The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.""Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends."
Nigeria to boost cocoa production,"The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.""People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,"" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters.Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.Cocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s.But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970"
US interest rates increased to 2%,"The Fed's Open Market Committee - which sets interest rate policy in the US - voted unanimously in favour of a quarter point rise.US interest rates are to rise for the fourth time in five months, in a widely anticipated move.The Fed has been gradually easing rates up since the summer, with quarter percentage point rises in June, August and September.The further rise in US rates is unlikely to have a direct bearing on UK monetary policy.The Federal Reserve has raised its key federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 2% in light of mounting evidence that the US economy is regaining steam.In a statement, the Fed said that long-term inflation pressures remained ""well contained"" while the US economy appeared to be ""growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices"".In a report published on Wednesday, the Bank said that with rates at their current level, inflation would rise to its 2% target within two years.""I think the Federal Reserve does not want to rock the boat and is using a gradual approach in raising the interest rate,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief US economist for Wells Fargo Bank.The Bank of England (BoE) has kept interest rates on hold at 4.75% for the past three months, leading some commentators to argue that rates may have peaked.Recent evidence has pointed to an upturn in the US economy"
US bank in $515m SEC settlement,"Separately, the SEC said it had reached a $140m deal - equally split between penalties and compensation - in its probe into Columbia Management Advisors (CAM) and Columbia Funds Distributor (CFD) and three ex-Columbia executives.The SEC also said it had brought fraud charges against two ex-senior executives of Columbia Distributor.Columbia Distributor was part of FleetBoston, bought by BOA last year.Three other ex-Columbia executives agreed settlements with the SEC.The SEC has set itself the task of stamping out the mutual funds' use of market-timing, a form of quick-fire, short-term share trading that harms the interests of small investors, with whom mutual funds are particularly popular.The SEC unveiled two separate settlements, one covering BOA's direct subsidiaries, and another for businesses that were part of FleetBoston at the time.The SEC agreed a deal totalling $375m with Banc of America Capital Management, BACAP Distributors and Banc of America Securities.In both cases, it said there had been secret deals to engage in market timing in mutual fund shares"
Train strike grips Buenos Aires,"It said it would put this commitment on paper.The Argentine Work Ministry has been mediating in the conflict and it could call an ""obligatory conciliation"", which would force both sides to find a solution and put an end to the conflict.The firm promised no jobs would be lost as a result of new ticket machines.Underground staff have warned they will continue with the protests until the management put an acceptable offer on the table"
Bargain calls widen Softbank loss,"The firm, a market leader in high-speed internet, had an operating loss for the three months to December of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; £38.4m).Japanese communications firm Softbank has widened losses after heavy spending on a new cut-rate phone service.The service, launched in December and dubbed ""Otoku"" or ""bargain"", has had almost 900,000 orders, Softbank said.The acquisition spurred its broadband internet division to pole position in the Japanese market, with more than 5.1 million subscribers at the end of December"
WMC profits up amid bid criticism,"Trade Minister Mark Vaile has said that the bid may be ""against the national interest"".Australian mining firm WMC Resources has seen a fivefold rise in profits while continuing to be the target of a hostile takeover bid.WMC said it made net profits of 1.33bn Australian dollars ($1bn; £550m) in 2004, up from A$246bn the year before.Mr Vaile, who was quoted in the Australian Financial Review, compared Xstrata's attempt to take over WMC to a similar bid by oil giant Shell for Australia's Woodside Petroleum in 2001.WMC itself, however, has no objection in principle to being bought out, having spun off its aluminium operations in 2002 to make itself a more tempting target - as long as the price is right"
Barclays profits hit record level,"Earnings at Barclays Capital investment bank rose 25% to £1.04bn, but investment in branch operations held back growth in its UK retail business.The cost overshoot is not in Barclays Capital but in the UK bank.""Barclays' chief John Varley said the bank had ""caught the winds"" of a very strong world economy.A tie-up between Barclays and California-based Wells Fargo would create the world's fourth biggest bank, valued at $180bn.Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Mr Varley declined to be drawn on reports that Barclays had held merger talks with US bank Wells Fargo.The bank also blamed margins pressure on its mortgage business and spending on its branches over the past year for a 1% fall in profits in its UK retail division to £1.13bn.Barclays, the UK's third-biggest bank, has seen annual pre-tax profits climb to record levels boosted by a sharp rise in business at its investment arm.According to analysts' forecasts, HSBC, the biggest UK bank by stock market valuation, will report profits of £9.4bn later this month"
Yukos owner sues Russia for $28bn,"Menatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to ""virtually nothing"" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%.Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal.The Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards.The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case.Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep.The Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill.""We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,"" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep.According to Menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments"
Qantas sees profits fly to record,"Qantas boss Mr Dixon also said he would be reviewing the group's cost-cutting measures.Qantas shares fell almost 3%, however, after it warned that earnings growth would slow in the second half.During the first six months of the fiscal year, Qantas made savings of A$245m, and is on track to top its target of A$500m for the full year.Australian airline Qantas has posted a record fiscal first-half profit thanks to cost-cutting measures.Qantas is facing increased pressure from rivals such as low-cost carrier Virgin Blue and the Australian government is in talks about whether to allow Singapore Airlines to fly between the Australia and the US - one of Qantas' key routes.Sales will dip by at least A$30m after the Indian ocean tsunami devastated many holiday destinations, Qantas said.Last month, the company warned it may transfer as many as 7,000 jobs out Australia, with Mr Dixon quoted as saying that the carrier could no longer afford to remain ""all-Australian"""
Iraq to invite phone licence bids,"The ministry said that it wanted to increase Iraq's ""very low telephone service penetration rate from about 4.5% today to about 25% within 10 years.""Bids have been invited from local, Arab and foreign companies, Iraq's Ministry of Communications said.The ministry said it would base its selection on criteria including the speed of implementation, tariff rates, coverage, and the firm's experience and financial strength.It also hopes to develop a ""highly visible and changeable telecommunication sector"""
Aviation firms eye booming India,"The US company also said it had agreed with a new Indian budget airline the sale of 10 737-800 planes for $630m.Giants such Boeing and Airbus - on the civil aviation front - as well as Lockheed Martin and France's Snecma - on the military side - are some of the firms attending the show.Airbus has also recently signed fresh deals with two Indian airlines - Air Deccan and Kingfisher.Meanwhile, flag carrier Air India is considering to buy 50 new aircraft from either Boeing or Airbus.India's defence minister has opened the country's Aero India 2005 air show with an invitation for global aerospace firms to outsource jobs to the nation.But the Indian Air Force is also considering proposals from other foreign firms such as France's Dassault Aviation, Sweden's Saab and Russia's Mikoyan-Gurevich.The US military industry has show a strong interest to open a link with India, now that relations between the two countries have improved a lot.Meanwhile, France's Snecma has also said it plans a joint venture with HAL to make engine parts, with an initial investment of $6.5m"
Russian oil merger excludes Yukos,"""Obtaining majority control over Gazprom is the beginning of the liberalisation of the market in Gazprom shares,"" Mr Miller added.The merger of Russian gas giant Gazprom and oil firm Rosneft is to go ahead, but will not include Yugansk, which was controversially bought last year.Gazprom chief Alexei Miller confirmed Rosneft-owned Yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off.Speaking on NTV television, which is controlled by Gazprom, Mr Miller added that Yugansk, which was swallowed up by Rosneft late last year, will operate as a separate, state-owned oil firm headed by current Rosneft chief Sergei Bogdanchikov.""Ultimately and industrially, Gazprom needs Yugansk,"" he added.But he said the latest development was simply an interim step to allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom.The merger, backed by Russian authorities, will allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom shares.The state wanted to control Gazprom before allowing foreigners to trade.Analysts said the deal would give Gazprom control of 8% of Russia's total oil production, an improvement on its current 2.5%, but still far less than the 20% share it would have gained had it also taken over Yugansk.Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company in a disputed auction in December, following what many thought was a politically-motivated attack on Yukos"
Brazil buy boosts Belgium's Inbev,"Belgian brewing giant Inbev has seen its profits soar thanks to its acquisition of Brazil's biggest beer firm Ambev last year.The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros.The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase.In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%.Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported"
Salary scandal in Cameroon,"The prime minister's office said the alleged fraud was uncovered during an investigation into the payroll at the ministry.The prime minister's office said auditors had found ""irregularities in the career structure of certain civil servants"".Prime Minister Ephraim Inoni, who vowed to tackle corruption when he came to office last year, said those found guilty would face tough punishments.Fidelis Nanga, a journalist based in the Cameroon capital Yaounde, said the government was considering taking criminal action against those found guilty and forcing them to repay any money owed.In a report compiled by anti-corruption body Transparency International in 2003, graft was said to be ""pervasive"" in Cameroon.""The prime minister has given instructions for exemplary penalties to be meted out against the accused and their accomplices if found guilty,"" he told the BBC's Network Africa programme"
US adds more jobs than expected,"The 337,000 new jobs added to US payrolls in October was twice the 169,000 figure that Wall Street economists had forecast.The US economy added 337,000 jobs in October - a seven-month high and far more than Wall Street expectations.Kathleen Utgoff, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor, said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in October were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in Florida, and neighbouring Deep South states, following four hurricanes in August and September.Other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when it meets next week.In addition, the Labor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139,000 in September instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in August instead of 128,000.In a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected President George W Bush, the Labor Department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains"
Feta cheese battle reaches court,"The Commission's controversial 2002 ruling gave ""protected designation of origin"" status to feta cheese made in Greece, effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there.A row over whether only Greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the European Court of Justice.The original decision was a victory for Greece, where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6,000 years.But critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term, with the cheese produced widely outside Greece.Denmark is Europe's second largest producer of feta after Greece - producing about 30,000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to Greece.The Danish and German governments are challenging a European Commission ruling which said Greece should have sole rights to use the name.The German and Danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years.Feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat's milk, and is an essential ingredient in Greek cuisine"
Ukraine revisits state sell-offs,"The new President, Viktor Yushchenko, has said a ""limited"" list of companies is being drawn up.""We say Krivorizhstal was stolen, and at any cost we will return it to the state,"" Mr Yushchenko told an investors' conference in Kiev.An open-ended list could further damage outside investors' fragile faith in Ukraine, said Stuart Hensel of the Economist Intelligence Unit.But the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in Russia, Mr Hensel said.A day earlier, Mr Yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted.But on Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms.""That way, Mr Yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules,"" he told BBC News.Ms Tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3,000 businesses which were to be reviewed.The list ""will be limited and final, and will not be extended after its completion"", he said.The privatisation review's number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included Viktor Pinchuk, Mr Kuchma's son-in-law, for $800m (£424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups.A resale of Krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Mr Hensel"
Bank set to leave rates on hold,"Richard Jeffrey, chief economist at Bridgewell Securities, said it was very unlikely that the Bank of England would put rates up again this time around.UK interest rates are set to remain on hold at 4.75% following the latest meeting of the Bank of England.The Bank's rate-setting committee has put up rates five times in the past year but rates have been on hold since September amid signs of a slowdown.However, Mr Jeffrey said he believed the slowdown in economic activity was temporary and it was dangerous to assume that rates had peaked.""I still think interest rates are going up,"" he said"
Winter freeze keeps oil above $50,"Oil prices carried on rising on Wednesday after cold weather on both sides of the North Atlantic pushed US crude prices to four-month highs.Declines in the dollar have also contributed to the rising oil price.Several Opec members said on Tuesday that a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia.Expectations that a rebound in the dollar would halt the oil price rise were not immediately borne out on Wednesday morning, as oil prices carried on upwards as the dollar strengthened against the euro, the pound and the yen.Freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls took crude oil prices past $50 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time since November.A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 at $51.15 in New York on Tuesday"
German jobless rate at new record,"And ILO-based figures also suggest that 14,000 new net jobs were created that month, taking the number of people employed to 38.9 million.Using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Germany had 3.97 million people out of work in January.Adjusted for seasonal changes, the overall unemployment rate is 4.875 million people or 11.7%, up 0.3 percentage points from the previous month.More than 5.2 million Germans were out of work in February, new figures show.The figure of 5.216 million people, or 12.6% of the working-age population, is the highest jobless rate in Europe's biggest economy since the 1930s.The soaring official unemployment figure follows a change in the methodology which pushed up the jobless rate by more than 500,000 in January"
Ore costs hit global steel firms,"Shares in Germany's ThyssenKrupp, the UK's Corus and France's Arcleor fell while Japan's Nippon Steel slid after it agreed to pay 72% more for iron ore. China's Baoshan Iron and Steel Co. said it was delaying a share sale because of weak market conditions, adding it would raise steel prices to offset ore costs.Vale Do Rio Dolce (CVRD) this week managed to boost by 72% the price of their iron ore, a key component of steel.Shares in steel firms have dropped worldwide amid concerns that higher iron ore costs will hit profit growth.Baoshan stock climbed on news of the delay and its decision to increase the price of its steel by 10%.Steel analyst Peter Fish, director of Sheffield-based consulting group MEPS, said the extent of CVRD's price rise was ""uncharted territory"", adding that the steel industry ""hasn't seen an increase of this magnitude probably in 50 years"".Steel prices rose by 8% globally in January alone and by 24% in China.The share price fall was initially triggered by news that two of the world's biggest iron ore suppliers had negotiated contracts at much-higher prices.The news triggered the share price weakness.Japan's biggest steel company Nippon Steel lost 2.5% to 270 yen, with closest rival JFE Holdings down 3.4%"
BMW reveals new models pipeline,"Typically it takes about three years from when a decision is taken before a new model hits the streets, Mr Panke said, implying that a BMW crossover could be on the market by 2008.""We have decided that BMW will enter the [crossover] segment,"" he said in the clearest indication yet about the car maker's intentions.""We have decided that the BMW brand will enter the segment,"" he said.While in the US drivers tend to prefer sports utility vehicles (SUVs), such as the BMW X5 and its sibling X3, in Europe demand for crossover vehicles is likely to be considerable, Mr Panke said.""There's a growing market here,"" he said.Speaking at a BMW event ahead of the Geneva motor show, Helmut Panke predicted demand for such crossover vehicles would soar in Europe"
Asian banks halt dollar's slide,"The dollar regained some lost ground against most major currencies on Wednesday after South Korea and Japan denied they were planning a sell-off.Japan is the biggest holder of dollar reserves in the world, with South Korea the fourth largest.The dollar's latest slide began after a South Korean parliamentary report suggested the country, which has about $200bn in foreign reserves, had plans to boost holdings of currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollar.Japan has $850bn in foreign exchange reserves.The dollar suffered its biggest one-day fall in four months on Tuesday on fears that Asian central banks were about to lower their reserves of dollars.A senior Japanese Finance Ministry official told Reuters ""we have no plans to change the composition of currency holdings in the foreign reserves, and we are not thinking about expanding our euro holdings"""
Weak dollar trims Cadbury profits,"Cadbury said its underlying sales were up by 4% in 2004.Cadbury said it was confident it would hit its targets for 2005.Growth was helped by its confectionery brands - including Cadbury, Trident and Halls - which enjoyed a ""successful"" year, with like-for-like sales up 6%.The modest profit rise had been expected by analysts after the company said in December that the poor summer weather had hit soft drink sales in Europe.Cadbury Schweppes employs more than 50,000 people worldwide, with about 7,000 in the UK"
Oil prices fall back from highs,"Oil prices retreated from four-month highs in early trading on Tuesday after producers' cartel Opec said it was now unlikely to cut production.He said that high oil prices meant Opec was unlikely to stick to its plan to cut output in the second quarter.On Monday, oil prices rose for a sixth straight session, reaching a four-month high as cold weather in the US threatened stocks of heating oil.Following the comments by acting Opec secretary general Adnan Shihab-Eldin, US light crude fell 32 cents to $51.43 a barrel"
Winn-Dixie files for bankruptcy,"Winn-Dixie, once among the most profitable of US grocers, said Chapter 11 protection would enable it to successfully restructure.It said its 920 stores would remain open, but analysts said it would most likely off-load a number of sites.Yet Evan Mann, a senior bond analyst at Gimme Credit, said Mr Lynch's job would not be easy, as the bankruptcy would inevitably put off some customers.US supermarket group Winn-Dixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after succumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by Wal-Mart.The company's new chief executive Peter Lynch said Winn-Dixie would use the Chapter 11 breathing space to take the necessary action to turn itself around"
Why few targets are better than many,"That's why the Kok report recommends that the Lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth.""Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing,"" the Kok report said.Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the Lisbon targets, five years on from their inception.But the Lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige.But some analysts believe that the Kok report doesn't come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets a reality.The economic targets set out at the Lisbon summit of European Union leaders in 2000 were meant to help Europe leapfrog its way past the United States to become the world's leading economy by 2010.""The [Lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change,"" said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council, a Brussels-based citizen action group.On one point Mr Kok was very clear: The European Union should not try to emulate the US economy.But part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in Lisbon five years ago.But meeting the Lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no EU member state has volunteered so far.The Kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth.The European economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth.Lisbon risks becoming a ""synonym for missed objectives and failed promises"", his report said.Targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the Lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the Wim report.""The US suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the European economy followed suit.""As Mr Kok's report noted: ""The ink had scarcely dried on the [Lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded.""The circumstances weren't conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by EU leaders in Lisbon in 2000.The EU's economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next.For many economists and analysts they are about ensuring Europe doesn't become a global economic laggard"
Malaysia lifts Islamic bank limit,"Malaysia's central bank is to relax restrictions on foreign ownership to encourage Islamic banking.Malaysia changed the law to allow Islamic banking in 1983.Banks in Malaysia will now be able to sell up to 49% of their Islamic banking units, while the limit on other kinds of bank remains at 30%.Islamic banks offer services which permit modern banking principles while sticking to Islamic law's ban on the payment of interest.The country's deal to join the World Trade Organisation set that year as a deadline for liberalisation of Islamic banking"
Alfa Romeos 'to get GM engines',"Fiat is to stop making six-cylinder petrol engines for its sporty Alfa Romeo subsidiary, unions at the Italian carmaker have said.The unions claim Fiat is to close the Fiat Powertrain plant at Arese near Milan and instead source six-cylinder engines from General Motors.Fiat has yet to comment on the matter, but the unions say the new engines will be made by GM in Australia.""Powertrain told us today that Alfa Romeo engines will no longer be made in Arese,"" said union leader Vincenzo Lilliu, as reported by the Reuters news agency.""The assembly line will be dismantled and the six-cylinder Alfa Romeo motor will be replaced with an engine GM produces in Australia."
Saab to build Cadillacs in Sweden,"Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car.As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine.Neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market.""We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today,"" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News.General Motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden.The car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market.Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe.It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster.Bringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year.GM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers.Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers.It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US"
Shares hit by MS drug suspension,"Shares in Elan and Biogen Idec plunged on Monday as the firms suspended sales of new multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri after a patient's death in the US.Elan, once the biggest firm on the Irish stock exchange, was also expected to receive a boost, from the new product.On the New York Stock Exchange, shares in Ireland-based Elan lost 70% while US partner Biogen Idec shed 43%.- Shares in UK pharmaceutical firm Phytopharm closed down 19.84% at 151.5 pence on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, after it said a partner was set to pull out of a deal on an experimental Alzheimer's disease treatment.Tysabri was approved for use in the US last November and was widely tipped to become the world's leading multiple sclerosis treatment.The cases cited involved the use of both Tysabri and Avonex, Biogen Idec's existing multiple sclerosis drug.""Most of the value in the company was in Tysabri,"" said Ian Hunter at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin"
Bank voted 8-1 for no rate change,"Worries over growth rates and consumer spending were behind the decision to freeze rates, the minutes showed.The Bank's minutes said that risks to the inflation forecast were ""sufficiently to the downside"" to keep rates on hold at its latest meeting.The decision to keep interest rates on hold at 4.75% earlier this month was passed 8-1 by the Bank of England's rate-setting body, minutes have shown.However, MPC member Paul Tucker voted for a quarter point rise in interest rates to 5%.One member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) - Paul Tucker - voted to raise rates to 5%.However, he added, any rate increase is not likely to happen until later this year, with MPC members likely to look for a more sustainable pick up in consumer spending before acting"
Crude oil prices back above $50,"Cold weather across parts of the United States and much of Europe has pushed US crude oil prices above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost three months.Several Opec members said a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia.A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday.""I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,"" Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya's oil minister, told Reuters.""I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel,"" he added.The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices.Freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall have increased demand for heating fuel in the US, where stocks are low"
House prices show slight increase,"House prices have risen 0.9% this year, Nationwide said, and if this pace of increase persists, prices would rise by just under 6% in the year to December.Nationwide said that in January house prices went up by 0.4% on the month and by 12.6% on a year earlier.New mortgage loans in January fell to 79,000 from 82,000 in December, the bank said.At the same time, the number of mortgage approvals fell in January to a near 10-year low, official Bank of England figures have shown.The annual rate has halved since August last year, as interest rises have cooled the housing market.He said if the growth continued at this level then the Bank of England may increase interest rates from their current 4.75%.Homeowners now expect house prices to rise by 1% over the next six months, Mr Bannister said.The Bank revealed that 48,000 fewer mortgages were approved in January than for the same month in 2004.There have been a number of warnings that the UK housing market may be heading for a downturn after four years of strong growth to 2004"
Golden rule boost for Chancellor,"After the ONS announcement, economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about £400m.It also said the government might narrowly miss its ""golden rule"" if the current economic cycle ended in 2005/06.In January the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Mr Brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year's Budget.The Conservatives also said Mr Brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual £10.5bn ""black hole"" in the nation's coffers.The changes by the ONS increase the current budget measure for the past five years by £2.1bn in total.But the Treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions.Correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment, thus helping Mr Brown to meet his ""golden rule"" of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle"
Macy's owner buys rival for $11bn,"US retail giant Federated Department Stores is to buy rival May Department Stores for $11bn (£5.7bn).As part of the deal, Federated - owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's - will assume $6bn of May's debt, bringing the deal's total value to $17bn.Federated has annual sales of $15.6bn, while May's yearly sales are $14.4bn.Federated expects the merger to boost earnings from 2007 but the deal will cost it $1bn in one-off charges.May has struggled to compete against larger department store groups such as Federated and other retailers such as Wal-Mart.The deal will bring together famous stores like Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Marshall Field's, creating the largest department store chain in the US"
Industrial revival hope for Japan,"Industrial output rose 2.1% - adjusted for the time of year - in January from a month earlier.Weaker exports, normally the engine for Japan's economy in the face of weak domestic demand, had helped trigger a 0.1% contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking GDP.With US growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in early 2005 could also be one of sustained demand.Electronics were also one of the keys to the improved domestic market, with products such as flat-screen TVs in high demand during January.Within the overall industrial output figure, there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown.At the same time, retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 1997"
Khodorkovsky ally denies charges,"Mr Khodorkovsky began his testimony last week, telling the court that he objected to the way that the ""running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction"".Platon Lebedev has been on trial alongside Mr Khodorkovsky since June in a case centring around the privatisation of a fertiliser firm.Mr Lebedev and Mr Khodorkovsky, who each face a possible 10 year jail sentence if convicted, will be questioned by a judge over the next few days.A close associate of former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky has told a court that fraud charges levelled against him are ""false"".Mr Lebedev said there were ""absurd contradictions"" in the case"
Qatar and Shell in $6bn gas deal,"ExxonMobil will be taking some 15 million tonnes each year for 25 years from the end of 2007 under the deal.France's Total is expected to join the ExxonMobil scheme, dubbed Qatargas-2, on Monday, taking 5 million tonnes of LNG a year.US oil giant ExxonMobil signed up for a $12.8bn deal earlier on Sunday"
India unveils anti-poverty budget,"But the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005-6 target for the deficit will be 4.3%, Mr Chidambaram said - falling short of the new law's requirement.Presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament, Mr Chidambaram said the Indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in.""Given the resilience of the Indian economy... it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty,"" Mr Chidambaram said.But his options are limited by a new law which makes him cut the budget deficit, which he said would be 4.5% of GDP in the year to March 2005.India's defence budget has also been raised 7.8% to 830bn rupees ($19bn).Under the fiscal responsibility law, Mr Chidambaram has to trim the deficit by 0.3 percentage points each year, a target he says he has now met for the current year.As part of his reforms he has announced:  - Duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials - Expanded service tax net - Raised the income-tax threshold to 100,000 rupees ($2,300) - Reduced income tax for those earning less than 250,000 rupees ($5,700) to 20% - Reduced corporate tax rates to 30%  An annual economic survey released on Friday said India needed to ease limit restriction on foreign investment, reform labour laws and cut duties apart from widening the tax base for long-term economic growth.But Mr Chidambaram is under pressure from the Communist parties to focus on increasing social spending.He said India's economy grew 6.9% in 2004.In his budget Mr Chidambaram has:  - Increased spending on primary education to 71.56bn rupees ($1.6bn) - Increased spending on health to 102.8bn rupees ($2.35bn) - Announced that 80bn rupees ($1.8bn) will be spent on building rural infrastructure - Pledged 102.16bn rupees ($2.3bn) for tsunami victims - Increased flow of funds to agriculture by 30% - Announced a package for the sugar industry  In addition, up to 100bn rupees ($2.3bn) to be spent on infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the country's foreign exchange reserves, keeping budgeted spending under control"
GM pays $2bn to evade Fiat buyout,"Instead, GM swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of Fiat - and gave Fiat a ""put option"" to sell GM the rest of the car maker between January 2004 and July 2009.Fiat had sold GM a stake in 2000, as part of a partnership agreement.""We needed scale in Europe to get costs down, and we were able to do that in working with Fiat,"" said GM chief executive Rick Wagoner.General Motors of the US is to pay Fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; £1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the Italian car maker outright.Analysts said Fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal, although some predictions had expected a 2bn euro pay-off.Fiat is to get 1bn euros immediately, with another 550m to follow within 90 days.But despite the alliance Fiat failed to put itself back on track, continuing to lose money and market share"
Ex-Boeing director gets jail term,"Ms Druyun had talks with Mr Sears in October 2002 about working for Boeing, while she was still a top procurement official within the Pentagon.Mr Sears told prosecutors that no other Boeing officials were aware that Ms Druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with Boeing.Boeing sacked Mr Sears and Ms Druyun in November 2003 after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy.Ms Druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to Boeing and other favoured companies.The Pentagon subsequently revoked $1bn worth of contracts assigned to Boeing and prohibited the Seattle-based company from future rocket work.Boeing lost a $23bn government contract after a Pentagon inquiry into the case.Ms Druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring Boeing when awarding lucrative contracts.Boeing was sued by Lockheed Martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition"
Verizon 'seals takeover of MCI',"Verizon has won a takeover battle for US phone firm MCI with a bid worth $6.8bn (£3.6bn), reports say.A merger between MCI and Verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October.The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-distance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $16bn.Last week, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn.MCI is the US's second-biggest long distance firm after AT&T.Buying MCI would give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers"
US data sparks inflation worries,"The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public.""The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,"" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management.Consumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed.But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was ""much less alarming"" than at first glance.""The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,"" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's.Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years"
Yukos sues four firms for $20bn,"Russian oil firm Yukos has sued four companies for their role in last year's forced state auction of its key oil production unit Yuganskneftegas.Yukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the US in an effort to regain control of the oil production business.As well as suing for damages, Yukos has asked the US court to send its tax dispute with the Russian government to an international arbitrator.The clash between Yukos and the Kremlin came to a head last year when Yukos was hit with a bill of more than $27bn in back taxes and unpaid fines.Analysts have questioned whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies, while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos' legal wrangling as meaningless.Yukos submitted the suit in Houston, where it filed for bankruptcy.The threat of legal action from Yukos and its bankruptcy filing in Houston did have an effect on last year's auction, however.Yukos is claiming more than $20bn (£11bn) in damages after Yugansk was sold in December to settle back taxes"
Consumer spending lifts US growth,"US economic growth accelerated in the third quarter, helped by strong consumer spending, official figures have shown.However, President Bush is expected to point to Commerce Department figures showing that consumer spending grew at 4.6% in the third quarter, up from just 1.6% in the second, as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth.The weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, economists said.""The economy regained some traction in the third quarter, but the growth is not robust,"" AG Edwards' Thayer.The figure marked an increase on the 3.3% growth recorded in the second quarter, but fell short of the 4.2% rate pencilled in by forecasters.Consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the US.The economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.7% in the July to September period, the Commerce Department said"
Crossrail link 'to get go-ahead',"Jeremy de Souza, a spokesman for Crossrail, said on Sunday he could not confirm whether the Treasury was planning to invest £7.5bn or when the bill would go before Parliament.The £10bn Crossrail transport plan, backed by business groups, is to get the go-ahead this month, according to The Mail on Sunday.It says the UK Treasury has allocated £7.5bn ($13.99bn) for the project and that talks with business groups on raising the rest will begin shortly.The Mail on Sunday's Financial Mail said the £7.5bn of Treasury money was earmarked for spending in £2.5bn instalments in 2010, 2011 and 2012.""We've always said we are going to introduce a hybrid Bill for Crossrail in the Spring and this remains the case,"" the Department for Transport said on Sunday"
Hariri killing hits Beirut shares,"Solidere, in which Mr Hariri was a major shareholder, was the major drag on the index.Shares in Solidere, the Lebanese company founded by assassinated former prime minister Rafik Hariri, fell 15% in renewed trading in Beirut.Critics had accused Mr Hariri of using Lebanon's post-war reconstruction drive for his personal financial gain.Traders said there was some panic selling during Friday's session, the first since a three-day market closure to mourn the death of Mr Hariri.The company owns much of the property in central Beirut, which it restored and redeveloped following the end of Lebanon's bitter 15-year civil war"
Small firms 'hit by rising costs',"A CBI quarterly survey found output had risen by the fastest rate in seven years but many firms were seeing the benefits offset by increasing expenses.When firms were questioned on output volume, the survey returned a balance of plus 8 - the highest rate of increase for seven years - and rose to plus 11 when looking ahead to the next three months.The CBI found some firms managed to increase prices for the first time in nine years - but many said increases failed to keep up the rise in costs.The CBI said companies are looking to the government to lessen the regulatory load and are hoping interest rates will be kept on hold.The CBI also found spending on innovation, training and retraining is forecast to go up over the next year"

House prices suffer festive fall,"UK house prices fell 0.7% in December, according to figures from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.The average UK house price fell from £180,126 in November to £178,906, reflecting recent Land Registry figures confirming a slowdown in late 2004.Nationally, house prices rose at an annual rate of 10.7% in December, less than the 13.7% rise the previous month.Although both the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Land Registry figures point to a slowdown in the market, the most recent surveys from Nationwide and Halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival"
Deutsche Boerse boosts dividend,"Deutsche Boerse, the German stock exchange that is trying to buy its London rival, has said it will boost its 2004 dividend payment by 27%.Deutsche Boerse is ""trying to buy them off in a sense"", he said.""Most of the disgruntled shareholders of Deutsche Boerse are complaining that the money that is being used for the bid could be better placed in their hands, paid out in dividends,"" Mr Faraj continued.Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse has offered £1.3bn ($2.48bn; 1.88bn euros) for the London Stock Exchange.Deutsche Boerse also said profit in the three months to 31 December was 120.7m euros ($158.8m; £83.3m)"
Newest EU members underpin growth,"The eight central European states which joined the EU last year will see 4.6% growth, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) said.UNECE is forecasting average economic growth of 2.2% across the European Union in 2005.Publishing its 2005 economic survey, the UNECE said central European countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovenia would provide the backbone of the continent's growth.The UK economy, on the other hand, is expected to slow in 2005, with growth falling from 3.2% last year to 2.5%.Global economic growth is expected to fall from 5% in 2004 to 4.25% despite the continued strength of the Chinese and US economies.Separately, the Bundesbank warned that Germany's efforts to reduce its budget deficit below 3% of GDP presented ""huge risks"" given that headline economic growth was set to fall below 1% this year.On Monday, Germany's BdB private banks association said the German economy would struggle to meet its 1.4% growth target in 2005.The European Union's newest members will bolster Europe's economic growth in 2005, according to a new report"
Brewers' profits lose their fizz,"Heineken and Carlsberg, two of the world's largest brewers, have reported falling profits after beer sales in western Europe fell flat.Heineken increased its dividend payment by 25% to 40 euro cents, but warned that the continued impact of a weaker dollar and an increased marketing spend may lead to a drop in 2005 net profit.Carlsberg is more optimistic than Heineken about 2005, projecting a 15% rise in net profits for the year.Dutch firm Heineken saw its annual profits drop 33% and warned that earnings in 2005 may also slide.Danish brewer Carlsberg suffered a 3% fall in profits due to waning demand and increased marketing costs.Heineken said it now plans to invest 100m euros in ""aggressive"" and ""high-impact"" marketing in Europe and the US in 2005.Carlsberg, the world's fifth-largest brewer, saw annual pre-tax profits fall to 3.4bn Danish kroner (456m euros).Nevertheless, total sales increased 4% to 36bn kroner, thanks to strong sales of Carlsberg lager in Russia and Poland"
Yangtze Electric's profits double,"Yangtze Electric Power, the operator of China's Three Gorges Dam, has said its profits more than doubled in 2004.The Three Gorges Dam project has led to more than half a million people being relocated and drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists.Yangtze Electric has been expanding its output to meet demand driven by China's booming economy.The firm has benefited from increased demand for electricity at a time when power shortages have hit cities and provinces across the country.Earlier this month, work was halted on an underground power station, and a supply unit on the Three Gorges Dam, as well as a power station on its sister Xiluodu dam because of environmental worries.Sales surged to 6.2bn yuan, from 3bn yuan a year earlier"
French consumer spending rising,"The National Statistic Institute (INSEE) added that consumer spending in January rose 3.8% on a year-on-year basis.The INSEE also said that French consumer prices fell 0.6% in January, but were up 1.6% on an annual basis.Despite the general increase in spending in January, French households bought fewer cars in January.French consumers increased their spending by 1.5% in January, a figure which bodes well for the country's economic growth, figures revealed.According to the INSEE, car sales fell 2.8% in January, following a fall of 0.6% in December"
GSK aims to stop Aids profiteers,"The company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in Africa who have re-sold humanitarian drugs for profit, as well as those suppliers in Europe that have also been involved in the trade.One of the world's largest manufacturers of HIV/Aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills - supplied to poorer African countries - back into Europe for resale at far higher price.The result is that drugs supplied to Africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in Europe; bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of HIV-positive Africans through their government's health care systems.Glaxo says distribution of the new-look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in Europe"
Optimism remains over UK housing,"Wimpey said the UK housing market had proved ""challenging"" last year.But B&B - which has a 22% share of the UK buy-to-let mortgage market - said that while rates of growth were moderating, the sector ""continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market"".B&B said the buy-to-let market - in which the bank is a major player - would continue to grow much faster than the wider mortgage market.Recent housing market surveys have indicated that the UK property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth.Overall, B&B said that ""housing market fundamentals remain strong"".The UK property market remains robust despite the recent slowdown, according to mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley and housebuilder George Wimpey.Wimpey reported a 19% rise in profits to £450.7m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected"
Russia WTO talks 'make progress',"While pinpointing several areas in which there are difficulties in the bilateral and multilateral work with Russia, the US said the meeting was ""much more efficient than we've seen for some time"".Mr Johannesson also said progress ""on the bilateral market access side is accelerating"".His comments came as President George W Bush said the US backed Russian entry.But he said for Russia to make progress the government must ""renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law"".Talks on Russia's proposed membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) have been ""making good progress"" say those behind the negotiations.Some WTO members also dislike Russia's energy price subsidies, which competitors say give Russian businesses an unfair advantage"

Dollar drops on reserves concerns,"The US dollar has dropped against major currencies on concerns that central banks may cut the amount of dollars they hold in their foreign reserves.South Korea, which has about $200bn in foreign reserves, said it plans instead to boost holdings of currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollar.At 1300 GMT, the euro was up 0.9% on the day at 1.3187 euros per US dollar.On Tuesday, traders in Asia said that both South Korea and Taiwan had withdrawn their bids to buy dollars at the start of the session.A report last month already showed that the dollar was losing its allure as a currency that offered rock-steady returns and stability.Compiled by Central Banking Publications and sponsored by the UK's Royal Bank of Scotland, the survey found 39 nations out of 65 questioned were increasing their euro holdings, with 29 cutting back on the US dollar"
India and Russia in energy talks,"Russian media reported that India and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation on Tuesday during a meeting between Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha, Gazprom chairman Aleksey Miller and India's petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar.India and Russia are to work together in a series of energy deals, part of a pact which could see India invest up to $20bn in oil and gas projects.On the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals, to be led by Russian energy giant Gazprom and India's ONGC.Russian news agencies reported that India's petroleum minister Mr Aiyar and Russian energy minister Viktor Khristenko would discuss the future of Yugansk at a meeting on Tuesday.ONGC could invest in gas and oil fields in Sakhalin, in the far east of Russia, and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern Siberia and the Caspian Sea.The agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining facilities in Russia, India and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil, gas and petrochemicals from Russia to India and other countries across Asia.India is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies - particularly liquefied natural gas - as domestic demand is growing at more than 5% a year.""What we are saying is - Gazprom has a huge amount of gas and we have the money.The former Yukos subsidiary was controversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by state-owned energy giant Rosneft"
Weak data buffets French economy,"""[The unemployment figures] show the main problem of the French economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment,"" said Marc Touati, an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires.""[Oil prices] will weigh on consumer spending in the short term, and potentially on confidence,"" he said.At the same time, finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed a threat to French growth.The French statistics agency, INSEE, expects the economy to grow by about 2.4% this year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment.Analysts said French companies, keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff"
Business fears over sluggish EU economy,"In Germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment.But Germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China.Boss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of orders closer to home.If Germany doesn't once again become the powerhouse of Europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be.""In the US growth is something like 6%, in China they are estimating 15%, and in the EU it is more or less 1%,"" he says.Which is strange because Lille is at the crossroads of Europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here.It specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many of those are being built in Europe these days.As European leaders gather in Rome on Friday to sign the new EU constitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business.They don't see what Europe is doing for them, so there is a kind of euro scepticism, especially in the working classes,"" he says.""Labour is too costly in Germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem.That is one reason why people here are not great fans of the EU, says Frederic Sawicki, a politics lecturer at the University of Lille.The euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world.With Germany making up a third of the eurozone's economy, this is a major problem.Director Hugues Charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the Far East are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while his key markets are now in China and India.New business has been attracted, but not enough to make up the difference.In Britain that would be a bad year; in Germany it is one of the best in recent years"
M&S cuts prices by average of 24%,"""We are bringing in ranges at new price points to compete against mid-market retailers like Next,"" said M&S.Stuart Rose, head of M&S, said last year its prices were too high.""We have brought in quite a lot of new clothing at new price points as part of Stuart Rose's strategy of quality, style -and price,"" said the M&S spokesman.However, an M&S spokesman said on Sunday it had no evidence that Mr Paulsmeier had lined up sufficient finance for a bid.DrKW said the cuts are either to clear stock or could indicate a longer term ""step change in pricing in certain areas"" at M&S.He also said the Takeover Panel and the UK's financial watchdog the Financial Services Authority had been in touch with M&S at the beginning of the week to find out what it knew about the Paulsmeier developments"
US bank 'loses' customer details,"New York Senator Charles Schumer said he was told by the Senate Rules Committee that the tapes were probably stolen from a commercial plane.Bank of America said the tapes went missing in December while being shipped to a back-up data centre.But although there was no evidence of criminal activity, the bank said, the Secret Service - a federal agency whose brief includes investigations of serious financial crime - is said to be looking into the loss.Customers' accounts were being monitoring and account holders would be notified if any ""unusual activity"" was detected, bank officials said.The Bank of America has revealed it has lost computer tapes containing account details of more than one million customers who are US federal employees"
Huge rush for Jet Airways shares,"Indian airline Jet Airways' initial public offering was oversubscribed 16.2 times, bankers said on Friday.Jet Airways, a low-fare airline, was founded by London-based ex-travel agent Naresh Goya, and controls 45% of the Indian domestic airline market.India began to open up its domestic airline market - previously dominated by state-run carrier Indian Airlines - in the 1990s.The price at which its shares will begin trading will be agreed over the weekend, bankers said.Over 85% of the bids were at the higher end of the price range of 1,050-1,125 rupees ($24-$26)"
Bank payout to Pinochet victims,"A US bank has said it will donate more than $8m to victims of former Chilean military ruler Augusto Pinochet's regime under a Madrid court settlement.The bank had been accused of illegally concealing Gen Pinochet's assets.Last month in a US court, Riggs Bank pleaded guilty to failing to report suspicious activity relating to accounts held by Gen Pinochet and the government of Equatorial Guinea.The bank agreed to create a fund for the victims, but the charges were dropped.The general's opponents rejoiced at the settlement, which was agreed in a court in the Spanish capital, Madrid.Riggs Bank will put money in a special fund to be managed by a Madrid-based charity, the Salvador Allende Foundation, which helps abused victims"
Qwest may spark MCI bidding war,"Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn.US phone company Qwest has said it will table a new offer for MCI after losing out to larger rival Verizon, setting the scene for a possible bidding war.MCI accepted a $6.75bn (£3.6bn) buyout from telecoms giant Verizon on Monday, rejecting a higher offer from Qwest.""We would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the Verizon merger agreement, we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire MCI,"" the letter from Qwest said.Verizon's offer is made up of cash, shares and dividends, and a number of investors have said that it undervalues MCI.Formerly known as Worldcom, MCI is a long-distance and corporate phone firm.Verizon plans to swap 0.41 of its shares and $1.50 in cash for each MCI share, as well as offering special dividends of $4.50 a share.Qwest chairman Richard Notebaert sent a letter to MCI's board on Thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining Verizon's bid"
Fiat chief takes steering wheel,"Mr Marchionne, who only joined the company last year, said Fiat Auto was now the ""principal focus"" of his attention.Sergio Marchionne has replaced Herbert Demel as chief executive of Fiat Auto, with Mr Demel leaving the company.Mr Demel, a car industry veteran, took the helm in November 2003 after being recruited by former Fiat chief executive Giuseppe Morchio.The chief executive of the Fiat conglomerate has taken day-to-day control of its struggling car business in an effort to turn it around.The car business has made an operating loss in five of the last six years and was forced to push back its break-even target from 2005 to 2006.Sales are expected to fall in 2005, Fiat said this week, as it exits unprofitable areas such as the rental car market.Fiat underperformed the market in Europe last year, seeing flat sales.GM will pay Fiat $2bn as part of the settlement"
Consumers drive French economy,"""In the beginning of 2004, growth was mainly driven by consumer spending.France's economic growth accelerated in the last three months of 2004, driven by consumer spending, a report shows.""France still has a strong economic growth,"" said Marc Toutai, an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires.Consumer spending was up by 1.2% in the fourth quarter, and there also was a rebound in business investment that gave the recovery an extra shove.""Consumer spending is still high.""It's an economic growth that seems well balanced,"" said Nicolas Claquin, an analyst at CCF.There's too much of a gap between growth and employment.""Despite the concerns, analysts pointed out that France was outperforming the majority of its European counterparts and that its economy was looking more robust than in previous years"
US regulator to rule on pain drug,"The European Medicines Agency also said doctors should be ""cautious"" about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease.""Given this new information, its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in Approve makes Vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the US,"" Mr Kim explained.US food and drug regulators will decide on Friday whether to recommend the sale of painkillers that have been linked to a high risk of heart attack and stroke.Putting Vioxx back on the shelves is likely to boost profits at Merck and make easier any legal battles with people who claim to have been injured by the drug, analysts said.Facing stem criticism for its handling of the Vioxx case, the FDA said on Tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place.Vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but Merck said it would consider selling it if it gets FDA approval.Alarm bells were rung by a research note called Approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least 18 months.The painkillers - called COX-2 inhibitors - are sold under brand names such as Celebrex and Vioxx"
Yukos bankruptcy 'not US matter',"Yukos says a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has a US subsidiary and local bank accounts.Deutsche Bank maintains the case has no place in a US court because Yukos has no assets in the US, apart from two bank accounts and a house in Houston owned by its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore.Russian authorities do not have to abide by any US court decisions taken with regard to troubled oil giant Yukos, a Houston court has been told.The company is also seeking $20bn in a separate US lawsuit against Rosneft and Gazprom for their role in the sale of Yugansk.Yukos has claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection.The US court's jurisdiction has been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft.That meant Moscow would not have to adhere to US rulings in the Yukos case"
Borussia Dortmund near bust,"Stephen Schechter, a UK investment banker who has held talks with Borussia Dortmund over a possible bond sale, said the club needs a capital injection of 35m euros.Borussia Dortmund has posted record losses and missed rent payments on its Westfallen stadium.German football club and former European champion Borussia Dortmund has warned it will go bankrupt if rescue talks with creditors fail.Shares in Borussia Dortmund, Germany's only stock-market listed football club, dropped by almost 23% to 2.05 euros during early afternoon trading.Borussia Dortmund posted a record loss of 68m euros ($89m; £47m) in the 12 months through June.The club has also faced calls to appoint executives from outside the club"
'Post-Christmas lull' in lending,"The CML said gross mortgage lending stood at £17.9bn, compared with £21.8bn in January last year.The CML said lending for house purchases and gross mortgage lending were 29% and 18% lower year-on-year respectively.Overall, the BBA said mortgage lending rose by £4bn in January, a far smaller increase than the £5.1bn seen in December.Both the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) and Building Society Association (BSA) said lending was down sharply"
UK 'risks breaking golden rule',"Other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy.The UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its ""golden rule"", a report suggests.A Treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying it was ""on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond"".Hinting at better times for UK exporters, NIESR said the euro zone ""is expected to pick up speed"".""Despite weak growth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006,"" NIESR said, adding that ""the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery"".Either way, fiscal tightening is needed, NIESR said.According to NIESR, if the government's current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is ""unlikely"" the golden rule will be met.The rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest, and not to finance its spending projects.The Treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008"
Worldcom director ends evidence,"Mr Sullivan, 42, has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following Mr Ebbers' trial, where he is appearing as a prosecution witness.Mr Sullivan has spent two days being cross-examined by lawyers for former Worldcom chief executive Mr Ebbers.Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom's collapse in 2002.Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom's finances.Attorney Reid Weingarten has attempted to portray Mr Sullivan as a liar and on Thursday quizzed him about his decision to commit fraud to meet analysts' profit estimates.The former finance officer said Mr Ebbers knew about the improper accounting entries that were made between 2000 and 2002 to conceal soaring expenses and inflate revenue"
Ukraine steel sell-off 'illegal',"On Wednesday, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed.The mill, Krivorizhstal, was sold in June 2004 for $800m (£424m) - well below other offers.The controversial sell-off of a Ukrainian steel mill to a relative of the former president was illegal, a court has ruled.Mr Yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to 30-40 enterprises.Krivorizhstal is one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous administration.The next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether, opening the way for Krivorizhstal to be resold"
Cairn shares up on new oil find,"Cairn said drilling to the north-west of its development site in Rajasthan had produced ""very strong results"".Before Christmas, Cairn revealed that drilling to the north of the field in Rajasthan had been disappointing, which caused its shares to lose 18% in one day.The firm has applied for a 30-month extension to scout for oil outside its main development area, which includes the Mangala and Aishwariya fields where Cairn has previously announced major discoveries.The company also said it now believed the development area would be able to produce oil for more than 25 years.Shares in Cairn Energy have jumped 6% after the firm said an Indian oilfield was larger than previously thought.Cairn's share price rose 300% last year after a number of oil finds, but its shares were hit in December following a disappointing drilling update"
Georgia plans hidden asset pardon,"Mr Saakashvili, elected president in January after Mr Shevardnadze was toppled, has urged the Georgian Parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible.The new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 January, three days before President Saakashvili was elected.Georgia is offering a one-off 'tax amnesty' to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president Eduard Shevardnadze.Mr Saakashvili has accused the Shevardnadze regime, which was toppled by a popular uprising in November, of allowing bribery to flourish.It is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption, which was rampant during the Shevardnadze era, and boost Georgia's fragile public finances.The country's new president, Mikhail Saakashvili, has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay 1% in income tax.""There are people who have money but are afraid to show it,"" the president told a government session.Georgia's economy is in a desperate condition"
Cuba winds back economic clock,"Fidel Castro's decision to ban all cash transactions in US dollars in Cuba has once more turned the spotlight on Cuba's ailing economy.Those remaining in Cuba will have to pay the tax.A leading expert on the Cuban economy says that Castro's tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture.The tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for Cuba's cash-strapped economy.All conversions between the US dollar and Cuba's ""convertible"" peso will from 8 November be subject to a 10% tax.It has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government's economic problems.Cubans living in the US are now limited to one visit to Cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives.Cuban citizens, who receive money from overseas, and foreign visitors, who change dollars in Cuba, will be affected.Mr Barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity.President Bush's government, which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade embargo on Cuba, introduced even tighter restrictions on Cuba in May.The tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading, Mr Barrionuevo said.Their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax, such as euros, or increase their dollar payments to compensate"

MCI shareholder sues to stop bid,"A shareholder in US phone firm MCI has taken legal action to halt a $6.75bn (£3.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant Verizon, hoping to get a better deal.The lawsuit was filed on Friday after Qwest Communications, which had an earlier offer for MCI rejected, said it would submit an improved bid.Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn.However, the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April.A number of large MCI shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that Verizon's offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company.A takeover of MCI would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases.According the legal papers filed in a Delaware court, Verizon is set to pay an """"unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate"" sum for MCI, which was formerly known as Worldcom"
'Standoff' on Deutsche's LSE bid,"Deutsche Boerse investors unhappy with its London Stock Exchange bid will have no chance to throw out the exchange's management until May, Reuters says.But Deutsche Boerse told news agency Reuters such a move would have to wait until May's annual general meeting.However, Deutsche Boerse told Reuters: ""TCI's request for the removal of the supervisory board will be considered at the annual general meeting on May 25.""The group owns more than 5% of Deutsche - more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the German exchange's management.Under German law Deutsche does not need investor backing to make a takeover bid.The Sunday Times reported that hedge funds TCI and Atticus were planning to demand the removal of the group's chairman and chief executive"
Bush to outline 'toughest' budget,"President Bush's proposals would see the Pentagon's budget rise by $19bn to $419.3bn while homeland security would get an extra $2bn.President Bush is to send his toughest budget proposals to date to the US Congress, seeking large cuts in domestic spending to lower the deficit.""With the deficits that we are now running, I am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget,"" he said.The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration in expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.Such belt-tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of President Bush's first term.The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, increased expenditure on national security after 9/11 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by President Bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit.Vice-President Dick Cheney said the budget was the ""tightest"" so far.Defence spending will rise, however, while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in Iraq.""The cost of everything he [President Bush] advocates explodes,"" he said.John McCain, a Republican Senator, said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit"

Mixed reaction to Man Utd offer,"Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer.But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid.David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a ""well funded"" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club.But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazer's latest financial proposal.His previous adviser, JPMorgan, quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board, against its advice.Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%.NM Rothschild, the investment bank, is advising Mr Glazer, according to the Financial Times.Mr Glazer's latest move is being led by Mr Glazer's two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times.A spokesman for the supporters club said: ""I can't see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer's previous proposals) other than £200m less debt.The board of Man Utd is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal from the US tycoon that values the club at £800m ($1.5bn).But the Man Utd supporters club urged the club to reject the new deal"
Gold falls on IMF sale concerns,"The price of gold has fallen after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief.While debt relief seems to have jumped to the top of the global agenda, not everyone is convinced that selling IMF gold is the best way forward.The US, which can veto any plan to sell IMF gold should it so choose, said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem.The IMF has 3,217 tonnes of gold, or about 113.5m ounces.The IMF values its gold reserves at between $40 and $50 an ounce, a price that was fixed in the 1970s and is about a tenth of the metal's current market value.IMF boss Rodrigo Rato was asked by G7 ministers to carry out a study into the feasibility of revaluing and selling gold reserves.By revaluing its holdings, the IMF may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the world's poorest nations"

Economy 'strong' in election year,"The BDO optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October.The only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said.""The UK is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,"" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward.Optimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at BDO Stoy Hayward.UK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report"
SEC to rethink post-Enron rules,"The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.The US stock market watchdog's chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (£374m).Mr Donaldson said the SEC would ""consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process"" for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements.The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing.European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly.Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings.Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would ""continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements"""

Ukraine trims privatisation check,"""We acknowledge that business in Ukraine is now shaped and 98% of privatisations were carried out according to the law,"" Mr Yushchenko said on Monday.""Russia is Ukraine's eternal strategic partner,"" Mr Yushchenko said.He said that while he understood that Ukraine was not ready for EU membership, the country needed to see progress on topics such as trade and visa requirements.Ukraine recently ousted long-serving leader Leonid Kuchma and has said it wants closer European Union links.Mr Yushchenko recently defeated Moscow-backed presidential candidate and Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych at the polls, and has made no secret of his wish to fight corruption and make Ukraine more transparent.Ukraine may find it has a sympathetic ear in Brussels ""The EU has reiterated that we support (Ukraine's) fast accession to the WTO and if possible we would like that to happen some time during the year,"" said Claude Veron-Reville, a spokesman for EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson.Mr Yushchenko was careful not to turn his back on Russia, which borders the country to the east, saying it was important to maintain 'pragmatic' ties with Moscow.Vice-Prime Minister Oleg Rybachuk called on the EU to recognise the steps that Ukraine was taking, fearing that should the country not be rewarded for its efforts there may be a backlash against closer relations with Brussels.In a separate statement, the EU said that the US should back Ukraine's entry into the World Trade Organisation.Her comments raised concerns among a number of investors and Mr Yushchenko was seen on Monday as trying to soothe their frayed nerves"

Firms pump billions into pensions,"The rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase, or defined contribution, schemes.A survey of 280 schemes by Incomes Data Services' (IDS) said employer contributions had increased from £5.5bn to £8.2bn a year, a rise of 49.7%.A final salary scheme, also known as a defined benefit scheme, promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire.IDS said there were some schemes in good health.Companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by 100% or more, IDS said.Helen Sudell, editor of the IDS Pensions Service, said the rise in contributions was ""staggering"" and the highest ever recorded by IDS.In contrast, between 1996 and 1998, some employers cut their contribution levels"
UK homes hit £3.3 trillion total,"More than a third of the UK's private housing assets - representing more than a trillion pounds in value - are concentrated in London and the South East, the Halifax's figures indicate.Research from Halifax, the country's biggest mortgage lender, suggests the value of private housing stock is continuing to rise steadily.The value of the UK's housing stock reached the £3.3 trillion mark in 2004 - triple the value 10 years earlier, a report indicates.Tim Crawford, Group Economist at Halifax, said: ""The value of the private housing stock continues to grow and the family home remains, by a large margin, the most valuable asset of the majority of households in the UK."
Economy 'strong' in election year,"The BDO optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October.The only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said.""The UK is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,"" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward.Optimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at BDO Stoy Hayward.UK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report"
G7 backs Africa debt relief plan,"Mr Brown said it was ""winning support every day"" and said a programme had been agreed to draw up more details in time for the G8 summit in July.G7 finance ministers have backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world's poorest countries.Mr Brown said G7 ministers had agreed to defer debt interest payments and repayments for some countries affected by the tsunami until the end of 2005.Mr Brown said it was a major breakthrough for the international organisations to offer up to 100% multilateral debt relief - ""the vast bulk"" of money owed by the poorest countries.UK chancellor Gordon Brown said the London meeting of the world's seven richest nations would be remembered as ""the 100% debt relief summit"".""We could be at the beginning of the final stage of the process where the debts that were owed by the poorest countries, built up over 20 or 30 years, debts that are simply unpayable in the real world, are finally taken care of,"" he said.But the US says it cannot support Mr Brown's International Finance Facility to boost aid to developing countries.G7 ministers called for more flexibility in international exchange rates and said ""excess volatility"" would impede economic growth.But US Treasury Under-Secretary John Taylor said the US could not support the IFF because of its ""legislative process"".But UK plans for an International Finance Facility (IFF) to help deal with debt in the developing world have not been agreed.He said much of the money pledged by the US had not yet been dispensed.BBC correspondents said the meeting had produced some movement towards the UK's ambitions, but much work was needed.BBC correspondent Patrick Bartlett said while it was an agreement in principle, the organisations involved now have to look at how it would work in practice.""The US is completely committed to poverty reduction and providing financing to do that,"" he said"
Q&A: Malcolm Glazer and Man Utd,"In October 2004, Manchester United said they had received a ""preliminary approach"", which turned out to have come from Mr Glazer.A previous approach to the United board by Mr Glazer in October last year was turned down.No bid emerged, but Mr Glazer continued to increase his holding in the club.Mr Glazer owns 28.1%.The battle for control of Manchester United has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from US business tycoon Malcolm Glazer.That would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed ""not... in the best interests of the company"" by Manchester United's board when they rejected his approach last year.At the club's annual general meeting in November, Mr Glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board.Supporters' group Shareholders United - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to Mr Glazer's campaign - said it would fight any move.""If that's the case then Mr Glazer might well secure their support - if he does, this bid could well go ahead.""However, Mr Glazer's latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by £200m.Joe McLean, a football specialist at accountancy firm Grant Thornton, said the support of Mr Magnier and Mr McManus was ""utterly crucial"".""Mr Glazer's bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment.Malcolm Glazer was little-known in the UK until he started to build up his stake in Manchester United in late 2003"
Making your office work for you,"In order for a virtual office to succeed, keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential.I would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn.The layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space.Referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space.Prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight, and the structure is checked for stability.Understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style.You may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area.A wireless router/access point in the house with a wireless LAN card in the PC in the renovated area may be sufficient.As for lighting, consider a combination of floor mounted uplights, wall lights (wall washers) and selected downlights.Do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others?The walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed, and the walls should be painted in a light colour.This week, we're hearing from Marianne Petersen, who is planning to convert a barn in Sweden into a base for her freelance writing work.It appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing.Over the next few months, our panel of experts will be listening to your gripes about where you work, and suggesting ways to make your workspace more efficient, more congenial or simply prettier.In order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating, power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate.Ideally, the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn.Please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for Marianne's barn"
Market unfazed by Aurora setback,"Despite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, Aurora is just one vessel in a large Carnival fleet, the UK's P&O Princess group having been merged into the much larger US firm in 2003.And with Carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated Aurora in the future.Similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited.After all, the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK - but for Carnival customers elsewhere it's unlikely to make too much of a splash.And generally speaking, Carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule.And its owner, P&O Cruises - now part of the huge US Carnival Corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential PR fiasco.In the wake of P&O Princess's takeover by Carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly.""The Aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,"" says Deutsche Bank's Simon Champion.""Carnival has an incredibly strong track record,"" Mr Champion.In other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited"
The 'ticking budget' facing the US,"Brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation's elderly and indigent.News coverage of the Bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts, but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs.Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together.The budget proposals laid out by the administration of US President George W Bush are highly controversial.Federal revenues are at 1950s levels, while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher.Indeed, if Congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way, there would hardly be any such spending left.The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China, among other nations.One thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the US economy and government for the challenges of this new century.This upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business.Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating ""waste, fraud and abuse"" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem.The biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor.Savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system, public and private.Even now, a growing share of US borrowing is from abroad.US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy.Under direct threat will be the federal government's ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund.By definition, the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn't adequately capture the current situation.The trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates, to more than half the nation's total annual output.From the standpoint of the big fiscal trends, the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come.The US population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats in the world.There will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget"
Ebbers 'aware' of WorldCom fraud,"Mr Sullivan is at the centre of the government's case against Mr Ebbers.However, on Monday Mr Sullivan named Mr Ebbers as one of five executives who participated in the accounting fraud.Mr Sullivan, WorldCom's former number two, is the government's chief witness in its case against Mr Ebbers.Mr Sullivan, 42, pleaded guilty to fraud last year and agreed to assist the government with its case against Mr Ebbers.Mr Ebbers has denied all the charges, saying he was unaware of the fraud.Prosecutors have alleged that Mr Ebbers, 63, directed Mr Sullivan to hide the true state of the company's finances by providing false information to the firm's accountants.Mr Ebbers has denied multiple charges of conspiracy and fraud.""He [Ebbers] has got a hands-on grasp of financial information,"" Mr Sullivan told a New York court.Mr Sullivan said his former boss knew more about accounting matters than many chief financial officers and described him as ""detail-oriented"""
Renault boss hails 'great year',"Strong sales outside western Europe helped Renault boost its profits by more than 40% in 2004 although the firm warned of lower margins this year.Chairman Louis Schweitzer said 2004 had been a ""great year"" for the firm.Renault said the outlook for the industry in Europe this year was ""stable"", with small growth forecast in other regions.The firm said strong demand outside western Europe and the good performance of its Megane range lifted its results.Japanese carmaker Nissan - in which Renault owns a 44% stake - contributed 1.7bn euros in net income over the year.In total, sales outside western Europe - Renault's core market - rose 16.5%"
Survey confirms property slowdown,"House prices were 11.8% higher on the year in the last quarter of 2004, down from 16.3% in the July-to-September quarter, the Land Registry said.The biggest annual gains were made in Wales, where house prices were up by 23% in the fourth quarter.After registering falls at the back end of 2004, Halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in January and Nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year.However, the figures are viewed as the most accurate measure of house prices as they include all property transactions, including cash sales.The average house price in England and Wales was £182,920, down from £187,971 in July-September.House prices rose the slowest in Greater London, being up by 6%"
Bush budget seeks deep cutbacks,"President Bush has presented his 2006 budget, cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at $427bn (£230bn) this year.Yet Mr Bush's proposed spending of $3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of $5bn.Military spending is also set to rise by 4.8%, to reach $419.3bn.The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.The state department's planned budget would rise to just under $23bn - a fraction of the defence department's request - including almost $6bn to assist US allies in the ""war on terror"".""In order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government,"" Mr Bush said in his budget message to Congress.Mr Bush has promised to halve the US's massive budget deficit within five years.But the budget is still the tightest yet under Mr Bush's presidency.The deficit, partly the result of massive tax cuts early in Mr Bush's presidency, has been a key factor in pushing the US dollar lower.The spending plan for the year beginning 1 October is banking on a healthy US economy to boost government income by 6.1% to $2.18 trillion.The $2.58 trillion (£1.38 trillion) budget submitted to Congress affects 150 domestic programmes from farming to the environment, education and health"
Profits stall at China's Lenovo,"But Western firms such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in China, and Lenovo's sales were down 3.7% by revenue to HK$6.31bn.The firm is in the international spotlight after last year signing a deal to buy the PC division of personal computer pioneer IBM.Lenovo's profit for the three months to December was HK$327m (US$42m; £22m), less than 1% up on the year before.The company is still by far the biggest player in China, with more than a quarter of the market.But investors have been less than impressed with Lenovo's move, designed to take it out of China and further onto the world stage.In any case, margins in PC market are now wafer thin, and profits have been hard to come by for most vendors except direct-sales giant Dell"
MCI shares climb on takeover bid,"Shares in US phone company MCI have risen on speculation that it is in takeover talks.The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Qwest has bid $6.3bn (£3.4bn) for MCI.Shares in MCI, which changed its name from Worldcom when it emerged from bankruptcy, were up 2.4% at $20.15.Competition has intensified and fixed-line phone providers such as MCI and AT&T have seen themselves overtaken by rivals.Buying MCI would give Qwest, a local phone service provider, access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers.The largest US telephone company Verizon has previously held preliminary merger discussions with MCI, Reuters quoted sources as saying.Other firms have also expressed an interest in MCI, the second-largest US long-distance phone firm, and may now table rival bids, analysts said"
BT offers equal access to rivals,"""Central to the proposals are plans by BT to offer operators lower wholesale prices, faster broadband services and transparent, highly-regulated access to BT's local network,"" the former monopoly said in a statement.""This is a reminder to Ofcom that as long as BT can change the dynamics of the whole broadband market at will, the process of opening up the UK's local telephone network to infrastructure investment and competition remains fragile,"" a spokesman said.""The United Kingdom has the opportunity to create the most exciting and innovative telecoms market in the world,"" BT chief executive Ben Verwaayen said.""BT has a critical role to play, and today we are making a set of far-reaching proposals towards that framework,"" he said.The move comes after telecom regulator Ofcom said in November that the firm must offer competitors ""real equality of access to its phone lines"".BT has moved to pre-empt a possible break-up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals.""I think it's the first productive thing we've had from BT,"" he said.To meet the growing demand for greater bandwidth, BT said it would begin trials in April with a view to launching higher-speed services nationally from the autumn.""The big question now is whether the industry, and particularly Ofcom feels BT's proposals go far enough ...Now the real negotiation begins,"" director of telecoms research Tony Lavender said.""BT has been challenged to play fair and its plans will introduce a level playing field.The scenario now is how well people execute their business plans as a service provider,"" chief executive Lee Strafford said"
Jobs growth still slow in the US,"The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office.Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions.The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.""The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,"" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover"
News Corp eyes video games market,"According to the Financial Times, chief operating officer Peter Chernin said that News Corp is ""kicking the tyres of pretty much all video games companies"".Video games are ""big business"", the paper quoted Mr Chernin as saying.News Corp, the media company controlled by Australian billionaire Rupert Murdoch, is eyeing a move into the video games market.France's Ubisoft, one of Europe's biggest video game publishers, has been trying to remain independent since Electronic Arts announced plans to buy 19.9% of the firm.And with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies, video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun.The success of products such as Sony's Playstation, Microsoft's X-Box and Nintendo's Game Cube have boosted demand for video games.""We are struggling with the gap between companies like Electronic Arts (EA), which comes with a high price tag, and the next tier of companies,"" he explained during a conference in Phoenix, Arizona"
Call to overhaul UK state pension,"The UK pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by a leading retirement think-tank.The think tank's proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the Pensions Commission's initial report into UK retirement savings.The report added that a combination of higher taxes, higher savings and/or a higher average retirement age was needed to solve the UK pension crisis.According to the Pensions Commission's report 12 million working people are not saving enough for their retirement"
Singapore growth at 8.1% in 2004,"However, a slower-than-expected fourth quarter points to more modest growth for the trade-driven economy in 2005 as global technology demand falls back.The economy's poor performance in the July to September period followed four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth as Singapore bounced back strongly from the effects of the deadly Sars virus in 2003.The advance, the second-fastest in Asia after China, was led by growth of 13.1% in the key manufacturing sector.""I am surprised at the weak fourth quarter number.That was up from the third quarter, when it fell 3.0%, but was well below analyst forecasts"
Turkey knocks six zeros off lira,"""The transition to the new Turkish lira shows clearly that our economy has broken the vicious circle that it was imprisoned in for long years,"" said Sureyya Serdengecti, head of the Turkish Central Bank.The Turkish economy teetered on the brink of collapse in 2001 when the lira plunged in value and two million people lost their jobs.""The new lira is also the symbol of the stable economy that we dreamed of for long years.""Turkey is to relaunch its currency on Saturday, knocking six zeros off the lira in the hope of boosting trade and powering its growing economy.The currency - officially to be known as the new lira - will be launched at midnight on 1 January.""The Turkish lira has been like funny money,"" Tevfik Aksoy, chief Turkish economist for Deutsche Bank, told Associated Press.From that point, the one-million lira note will become the new one-lira coin.""If a person has 10 billion lira in investments this will suddenly decrease,"" shop owner Hayriye Evren, told Associated Press.The change will see the end of such dizzyingly-high denominations as five million lira - enough for a short taxi ride - and the 20m note, worth $15"
S Korea spending boost to economy,"""The focus will be on job creation and economic recovery, given that unfavourable domestic and global conditions are likely to dog the Korean economy in 2005,"" the ministry said.""Given the economic spill over and employment effect in the construction sector, a sharp downturn in the construction industry could have other adverse effects,"" the ministry said.""Internal and external economic conditions are likely to remain unfavourable in 2005,"" the Finance and Economy Ministry said in a statement.In 2004, growth will be between 4.7% and 4.8%, the ministry said.South Korea will boost state spending next year in an effort to create jobs and kick start its sputtering economy.The government has set an economic growth rate target of 5% for next year and hinted that would be in danger unless it took action.As a result, South Korea will give private companies also will be given the chance to build schools, hospitals, houses and other public buildings.As part of its spending plans, the government said it will ask firms to ""roll over mortgage loans that come due in the first half of 2005"" "
Latin America sees strong growth,"The United Nations' Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean said the region grew by 5.5% this year.ECLAC also said that the six largest Latin American economies (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) grew by more than 3% for only the second time in 20 years.Latin America's economy grew by 5.5% in 2004, its best performance since 1980, while exports registered their best performance in two decades.In fact, Latin American exports to China grew 34%, to $14bn.Chinese and US economic strength helped boost exports, as did strong demand for agricultural and mining products"
Asia shares defy post-quake gloom,"In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman.""Our nation is in peril here,"" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman.Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday.In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost.Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.""It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,"" he said.Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m.He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars.Thailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.""Calculators will have to wait,"" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday.However, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact"
Booming markets shed few tears,"Stock markets in Indonesia and India have hit all-time highs this week; even in Sri Lanka, more comprehensively affected, the main index has lost only 5% since the waves hit.Second, stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged.The MSCI World share index, a measure of global stock market performance, hit its highest level this week since early 2001; the BBC Global 30 has risen by 3% in the past week.Even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $30 trillion and rising.And where insurance certainly is in place - in, for example, the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market, rather than landing locally.The trillion-dollar debts of Japan's banks, for example, have had no effect on stock markets further afield than Tokyo.But disasters have a vast psychological impact, and markets are driven by psychological factors.In fact, the markets are being perfectly rational.And indeed, stock exchange traders around Asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week's disaster.Asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies, many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities.A study of the 1993 Des Moines floods, from the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware*, found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster, and another 18% felt themselves better off.Bigger markets further afield have barely twitched.And the US stock market was on its way down long before 11 September, 2001; it rose by 20% during the six months following the attacks.For a start, the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines"
Asian quake hits European shares,"The unfolding scale of the disaster in south Asia had little immediate impact on US shares, however.But the disaster has little impact on stock markets in the US and Asia.Shares in Munich Re and Swiss Re - the world's two biggest reinsurers - both fell 1.7% as the market speculated about the cost of rebuilding in Asia.In India, where more than 2,000 people are thought to have died, the rupee shed 0.1% against the dollar Analysts said that it was difficult to predict the total cost of the disaster and warned that share prices and currencies would come under increasing pressure as the bills mounted.Shares in Europe's leading reinsurers and travel firms have fallen as the scale of the damage wrought by tsunamis across south Asia has become apparent.The Thai baht lost 0.3% against the US currency, trading at 39.10.Shares fell just 0.03%.Investors pointed out, however, that declines probably would be industry specific, with the travel and insurance firms hit hardest.However, the overall impact on Asia's largest stock market, Japan's Nikkei, was slight.Reisurance firms such as Swiss Re and Munich Re lost value as investors worried about rebuilding costs.Travel companies also took a hit, with Japan's Kinki Nippon sliding 1.5% and HIS dropping 3.3%.Insurers and reinsurance firms were also under pressure in Europe.Germany's benchmark Dax index closed the day 16.29 points lower at 3.817.69 while France's Cac index of leading shares fell 5.07 points to 3.817.69.Travel-related shares dropped in Europe, with companies such as Germany's TUI and Lufthansa and France's Club Mediterranne sliding"
Split-caps pay £194m compensation,"Eighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA).Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added.In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £350m in compensation.Further details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year.""This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome,"" Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News"
French suitor holds LSE meeting,"European stock market Euronext has met with the London Stock Exchange (LSE) amid speculation that it may be ready to launch a cash bid.Euronext, so far, has given little away as to what sweeteners it will offer the LSE - Europe's biggest equity market - into a deal.Deutsche Boerse previously offered £1.3bn, which was rejected by the LSE, while Euronext is rumoured to have facilities in place to fund a £1.4bn cash bid.Euronext chief Jean-Francois Theodore held talks with LSE boss Clara Furse the day after rival Deutsche Boerse put forward its own bid case.Commentators believe Deutsche Boerse, which has now formally asked German authorities to approve its plan to buy the LSE, may offer to sell Clearstream to gain shareholder approval.There was speculation Euronext would use Friday's meeting as an opportunity to take advantage of growing disquiet over Deutsche Boerse's own plans for dominance over the London market.Meanwhile, LSE shareholders fear that Deutsche Boerse's control over its Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions - would create a monopoly situation.Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt has reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful"
Troubled Marsh under SEC scrutiny,"The US stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker Marsh & McLennan's shareholder transactions, the firm has said.Marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the SEC investigation.Marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the New York attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market.Since that inquiry was launched in October, Marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board.Prosecutors allege that Marsh - the world's biggest insurance broker - and other US insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover.The uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch - to downgrade Marsh in recent weeks"
Could Yukos be a blessing in disguise?,"But it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all Russian firms, even targets of the tax police.The calculations demonstrated what many Russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable.The net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.Since then, the Russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach.The report highlights the case of Sibneft, a Russian oil company that came close to merging with Yukos last year.""An increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,"" the authors say.According to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through Russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at Sibneft and many of its peers.Genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in Russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced.And the authors' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically Western.The paper's reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company.On the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately.For all its faults, corporate Russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000"
Nasdaq planning $100m share sale,"The owner of the technology-dominated Nasdaq stock index plans to sell shares to the public and list itself on the market it operates.The Nasdaq is made up shares in technology firms and other companies with high growth potential.Nasdaq will not make money from the sale, only investors who bought shares in the private placings, the filing documents said.According to a registration document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nasdaq Stock Market plans to raise $100m (£52m) from the sale"
Giving financial gifts to children,"Therefore, it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the Child Trust Fund which is tax free, with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual £1,200 limit being directed to a deposit account.As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children's deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund.If the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance.Where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child, consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents' gifts and one for gifts from other relatives.Interest earned by children is subject to income tax.The tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child.There are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest.The only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18, and parents will have no control over how it is spent.This confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.The government is trying to encourage saving at an early age, through its new Child Trust Fund.Parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to £1,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax.Only £100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free.It may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs, for example.Where interest exceeds this level, the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent.This is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children's names and taking advantage of the tax allowances.The parent or guardian will be responsible for the Bonds and will receive notification of the purchase"
Air China in $1bn London listing,"Merrill Lynch are sole bookrunners for Air China's flotation, which will take the form of a share placing with institutional investors in London, though retail investors may be able to buy Air China shares in Hong Kong.""We are delighted that Air China has chosen London for its listing outside China,"" said LSE chief executive Clara Furse.Air China's primary listing will be in Hong Kong, with a secondary listing in London.China's national airline is to make its overseas stock market debut with a dual listing in London and Hong Kong, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) has said.Air China's long-awaited flotation is part of a strategy to modernise a dozen state-owned carriers, which have been reorganised into three groups under Air China, China Southern and China Eastern.A spokesman for the LSE said: ""We've been engaged with them (Air China) for about 18 months, two years now.""Air China plans to raise $1bn (£514m) from the flotation.The shares will be denominated in Hong Kong dollars"
Oil prices reach three-month low,"Oil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three-month lows after news that US crude stocks have improved ahead of winter.The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago.However, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec's attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output.Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices.Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September.The price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October.The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days.Analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil.The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth.Analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise.However, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world"
Arsenal 'may seek full share listing',"Speaking at the Soccerex football business forum in Dubai, he said a full listing was ""one of the options"" for funding after the club moves to its new stadium.Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange.The club - which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 2006/07 season.The club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover, and has not ruled out other money-earning means, including a full share listing.""When the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review,"" Mr Dein said.When Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years' time.The club is funding its move to Ashburton Grove through a number of sources, including debt from banks, from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors, and from the sale of surplus property, including its Highbury Stadium.Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season"
Markets signal Brazilian recovery,"Investors have praised his handling of the economy as foreign investment has risen, unemployment has fallen and inflation has been brought under control.The Brazilian stock market has risen to a record high as investors display growing confidence in the durability of the country's economic recovery.However, Mr da Silva has stuck to an orthodox monetary policy inherited from his predecessor even in the face of last year's economic crisis.President da Silva has defended his policies, arguing that Brazil cannot afford to continue the cycle of boom and bust which afflicted it in recent decades.Economic output declined 0.2% in 2003 and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva - elected as Brazil's first working-class president in 2002 - was strongly criticised for pursuing a hardline economic policy.Analysts believe the stock market will rise above the 25,000 mark for the first time before too long.Although interest rates still stand at a punitive 17.25%, inflation has fallen from 9% to 7% while exports are booming, particularly of agricultural products"
Markets fall on weak dollar fears,"And Mr Greenspan warned Asian states could soon stop funding the US deficit.And Mr Greenspan said that could turn into a trend, if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the value of those investments.The slide comes as the US has been attempting to talk up the traditional ""strong dollar"" policy.""It seems persuasive that, given the size of the US current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point,"" he said.For the US government, letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term fix.Rising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on Monday after a finance ministers' meeting and stern words from Fed chief Alan Greenspan.G20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in Japan and Europe.At present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to Asian states such as Japan and China, since the dollar is seen as the world's reserve currency.Similarly, Asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the US as a whole spends and what it earns.US exports get more affordable, helping perhaps to close the trade gap"
Google shares fall as staff sell,"Google shares have risen since but fell $12.33 on Tuesday to close at $172.55.There were fears that the potential increase of shares in circulation from Tuesday would ease demand for stock.In one of the most closely-watched initial public offerings in stock market history, the US-based company sold 19.6 million shares at $85 each.Selling the shares could turn many of Google's workers into millionaires.However, analysts say they expected most shareholders would be holding back from selling all their shares immediately, as Google's good performance and future growth potential means demand will hold"
Five million Germans out of work,"Germany's unemployment figure rose above the psychologically important level of five million last month.""Yes, we have effectively more than five million people unemployed,"" a government minister said earlier on ZDF public television.On Wednesday, the German Federal Labour Agency said the jobless total had reached 5.037 million in January, which takes the jobless rate to 12.1%.It said there are a further 1.5 million-2 million people on subsidised employment schemes who are, in fact, looking for real jobs.But the figures are embarrassing for the government.The opposition also made political capital from the figures"
India power shares jump on debut,"Shares in India's largest power producer, National Thermal Power Corp (NTPC) have risen 13% on their stock market debut.""Power needs in India are set to rise and NTPC will benefit from that.""NTPC has said it will use the money from the share sale to feed the growing needs of the country's energy-starved economy.Analysts say the success of the NTPC flotation would encourage the government to reduce stakes in more power companies"
Turkey turns on the economic charm,"If admitted into the EU, Turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros ($8bn; £6bn) to its budget by 2014, according to a recent impact study by the country's State Planning Organisation.Critics insist that much of the optimism about Turkey's economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a 134% rise in the country's current account deficit to $10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year.As Turkey's gross domestic output (GDP) is set to grow by 6% per year on average, its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020.Three years after a gruelling economic crisis, Turkey has dressed its economy to impress.However, Turkey's assertions are confirmed by Brussels' own impact studies, which indeed say that Turkish membership would be good news for the EU economy.A key factor for EU decision makers should be whether or not Turkey has met its economic criteria.The point of all this has been to convince Europe's decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the EU, allowing Turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits.""Turkey will not be a burden for the EU budget.""The country's massive debt - which includes $23bn owed to the IMF and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the EU.Costs are projected to be vast during the early years of Turkey's membership, with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and, according to some predictions, balloon to 33.5bn euros.""At about 80% of GDP, Turkey's gross debt is double that figure.""Turkey's debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country's devastating recession.The tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to $21bn (£10.8bn) in three years.""In the new member states of the European Union, gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product,"" says Reza Moghadam, assistant director of the IMF's European Department.Such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by Turkey's government would never be delivered, say those who feel the Turkish project should be shunned.And although the state of Turkey's economy is important, as is its pace of reform, the final decision on 17 December will be taken by politicians who will, of course, be guided by their political instincts"
SBC plans post-takeover job cuts,"US phone company SBC Communications said it expects to cut around 12,800 jobs following its $16bn (£8.5bn) takeover of former parent AT&T.SBC and AT&T said estimated cost savings of at least $2bn from 2008 were a main driver for the merger.SBC said 5,125 positions would go as a result of network efficiencies.SBC currently employs 163,000 people while AT&T employs 47,000.AT&T is a long-distance telecoms firm, while SBC is mainly focused on the local market in the western US"
German bidder in talks with LSE,"Deutsche Boerse bosses have held ""constructive, professional and friendly"" talks with the London Stock Exchange (LSE), its chief has said.But, Hans Reckers, a board member of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said that cash trading should also remain in Frankfurt, something Deutsche Boerse could move to the UK.The news came as Deutsche Boerse held its third meeting with the LSE since its bid approach in December which was turned down by the London exchange for undervaluing the business.Ahead of talks with the LSE on Friday, the pan-European bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash.Deutsche Boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home.In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE.Werner Seifert met LSE chief executive Clara Furse amid rumours the German group may raise its bid to £1.5bn ($2.9bn) from its initial £1.3bn offer.""It is not just the headquarters of the Boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in Frankfurt"
Amex shares up on spin-off news,"The US credit card to travel services giant said off-loading American Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) would boost its profitability.The unit was acquired by American Express 20 years ago as Investors Diversified Service, of Minneapolis, at a time when firms were amassing one-stop financial empires.Shares in American Express surged more than 8% on Tuesday after it said it was to spin off its less profitable financial advisory subsidiary.AEFA has more than 12,000 advisers selling financial advice, funds and insurance to 2.5 million customers"
Axa Sun Life cuts bonus payments,"Regular annual bonus rates on former Axa Equity & Law with-profits policies are to be cut from 2% to 1% for 2004.Axa blamed a poor stock market performance for the cut, adding that recent gains have not yet offset the market falls seen in 2001 and 2002.Axa cut payouts for the same investors last January.""The stock market has grown over the past 18 months, however not enough to undo the damage that occurred during 2001 and 2002,"" Axa spokesman Mark Hamilton, Axa spokesman, told BBC News.Life insurer Axa Sun Life has lowered annual bonus payouts for up to 50,000 with-profits investors"
Chinese dam firm 'defies Beijing',"The China Three Gorges Project Corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams, the Chinese state press has said.The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the Three Gorges Underground Power Plant and the Three Gorges Project Electrical Power Supply Plant.The China Three Gorges Project Corp could now face a fine up to 200,000 yuan ($24,000; £12,700).The builder of the Three Gorges Dam is continuing work on the sister Xiluodu dam, said the Beijing News.""The Three Gorges Corporation has all along abided by the law and have built our projects in accordance with the law,"" it said.It is a sister project to the main Three Gorges Dam downstream where more than half a million people have had to be relocated, drawing criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists"
Stock market eyes Japan recovery,"Japanese shares have ended the year at their highest level since 13 July amidst hopes of an economic recovery during 2005.Earlier this month, the quarterly Tankan survey of Japanese manufacturers found that business confidence had weakened for the first time since March 2003.The Nikkei index of leading shares gained 7.6% during the year to close at 11,488.76 points.The optimism in the financial markets contrast sharply with pessimism in the Japanese business community"
Iraqi voters turn to economic issues,"Blackwatch's Baghdad-based affiliate Falcon Group has dozens of people working for it across the country in Kirkuk and Baghdad, and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the Iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, Mr Hadi points out.But the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many Iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes Ms Alexander.Yet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed, insists Mr Hadi, an Iraqi who left the country three decades ago.""It is seen as a selling off of Iraq's assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of Iraqi businesses and Iraqi workers,"" she says.The economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of Sunday's election, according to Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq.National Bank of Kuwait has bought a majority stake in Credit Bank of Iraq, the Jordanian investment bank Export & Finance Bank has bought 49% of National Bank of Iraq.Mr Hadi's Blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future.Consequently, the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100% foreign ownership of Iraqi assets, she explains.Observes Mr Hadi: ""The economy at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer.""Hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into the sector.""I think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast,"" Mr Hadi says.The Iraqi business people will do business at all times.Many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act, yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way.Mr Hadi's view about what the new government's priorities should be is shared by many Iraqis"
EU 'too slow' on economic reforms,"But the Commission report says that, in most EU countries, the pace of economic reform has been too slow, and fulfilling the Lisbon ambitions will be difficult - if not impossible.Their economic targets became known as the Lisbon Agenda.In 2000, EU leaders at a summit in Lisbon pledged the European economy would outstrip that of the US by 2010.Most EU countries have failed to put in place policies aimed at making Europe the world's most competitive economy by the end of the decade, a report says.The Lisbon Agenda set out to increase the number of people employed in Europe by encouraging more older people and women to stay in the workforce"
China continues breakneck growth,"And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004.Despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said.Growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year.China's economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003's 9.1%.China raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in October 2004.China's economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas.But officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus.Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate"
Japan's ageing workforce: built to last,"Glen Wood, Vice President of Deutsche Securities Japan, asks; ""Who's going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new Japanese worker?And when it comes to longevity, Japan, as a country, appears to be doing just that.In contrast to Japan - and of course the European Union - the US population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century.""Japan has never really liked that option in its history and I think it's an option that's becoming more and more plausible and necessary,"" insists Mr Wood.Mr Toshitsune is one of Japan's 23,000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114.Come 2020, Japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power.""Japan still has problems getting a viable banking system, let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas,"" says Mr Wood.In Japan, as in Europe which also faces a workforce decline, immigration is a very sensitive subject.Japan is the world's least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the US.At his neat Osaka detached house, where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters, Mr Toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out Buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony.The International Monetary Fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running Japan's welfare state will double to more than 5% of GDP, while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%.But unfortunately, Japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically.Japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession.Mr Toshitsune wants to outlive everyone.By 2007, Japan's population is expected to peak at 127 million, then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century.But, as yet, Japan is not ready for an Ellis Island.But while life may be a game of golf for Mr Shimizu, his grandchildren have huge problems ahead.Between tasks, this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is: ""Well, what's most important for me is to be Japan's number one.""""Who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the leaders"
GE sees 'excellent' world economy,"GE said orders in the fourth quarter were 15% higher than in the same period of 2003, ""with growth across the board"".""In the fourth quarter, nine of our 11 businesses delivered at least double-digit earnings growth,"" said Mr Immelt.Last year, GE bought Vivendi Universal, merging it with NBC to form NBC Universal.The materials, financial and industrial sectors are all picking up,"" said Steve Roukis, an analyst at fund manager Matrix Asset Advisors, which has shares in GE.GE's net profits were $5.37bn (£2.86bn) for the final three months of 2004, while sales came in at $43.7bn.""We are benefiting from our growth initiatives and an excellent global economy,"" said GE's chief executive Jeff Immelt"
UK economy facing 'major risks',"""Despite some positive news for the export sector, there are worrying signs for manufacturing,"" the BCC said.The BCC found confidence increased in the quarter across both the manufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the levels at the start of 2004.The outlook for the service sector was ""uncertain"" despite an increase in exports and orders over the quarter, the BCC noted.The UK manufacturing sector will continue to face ""serious challenges"" over the next two years, the British Chamber of Commerce (BCC) has said.However, the BCC found the whole UK economy still faced ""major risks"" and warned that growth is set to slow.The reduced threat of interest rate increases had contributed to improved confidence, it said.The rise came despite exchange rates being cited as a major concern"
Bank holds interest rate at 4.75%,"CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had ""slowed in recent months in response to rate rises"" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer.Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future.""The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,"" he said.The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.""So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,"" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley.It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.Rates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August.Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium.""Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time."
Tobacco giants hail court ruling,"Anti-smoking groups urge the government to fight on, but the Justice Department has not said if it will appeal.Charles A Blixt, executive vice-president of RJ Reynolds Tobacco, said the ruling ""dramatically transforms"" the government's lawsuit.US tobacco companies have welcomed an appeal court's decision to reject the government's $280bn (£155bn) claim for alleged deceit about smoking dangers.""Today's ruling should not be an excuse for this administration to seek a weak settlement that lets the tobacco industry off the hook,"" he said.Among the accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson.Altria Group said, in a statement, the government now ""must not only prove that the companies have engaged in fraudulent behaviour in the past, but that they are likely to do so in the future.""The three-judge panel in the District of Columbia's Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that the US government could not sue the firms under the anti-racketeering laws.The government had claimed tobacco firms   - manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction - targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns - lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary"
Steady job growth continues in US,"Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy.Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election.The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.""Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.""While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said.The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop"
Glazer makes new Man Utd approach,"Malcolm Glazer has made a fresh approach to buy Manchester United, which could lead to a bid valuing the Premiership club at £800m.""The campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since Glazer first showed interest in the club.""The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with ""detailed proposals"", it has confirmed.They have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by Glazer since he first showed interest in the club in September 2003 and after Sunday's announcement they vowed to fight on.Last week, however, Mr Glazer issued a statement to the Stock Exchange distancing himself from a new bid.Mr Glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the Red Devils and responded by using his 28.1% shareholding to vote off three board members last November.Mr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted.Now the board has confirmed that the US bidder is back, with a statement issued on Sunday reading: ""The board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer"
Wall Street cheers Bush victory,"Senator Kerry attacked President Bush's economic record during his campaign, hammering home the fact that a net 800,000 jobs were lost during his term in office.The US stock market has closed higher in response to George W Bush's victory in the presidential elections.The higher share prices also reflect relief that a clear winner has emerged from what proved to be a tight poll.The rise in oil prices partly reflects the view that President Bush is less likely than Mr Kerry to release supplies from the US' strategic oil reserve.In key swing states such as Ohio, which has suffered substantial job losses in the past four years, President Bush's handling of the economy became a crucial election issue.President Bush has placed reform of the pensions system at the heart of his economic agenda for a second term.President Bush focused on the fact that two million jobs have been created in the past year, claiming that it has vindicated his tax-cutting agenda.The US' recent economic performance has been mixed, with solid growth offset by disappointingly low job creation figures, and mounting worries over a record budget deficit.Share prices in London, Frankfurt and Paris also closed higher.Some analysts predicted that the jump in share prices would be short-lived, saying investors would quickly focus once again on the health of the US economy"
Business confidence dips in Japan,"Business confidence among Japanese manufacturers has weakened for the first time since March 2003, the quarterly Tankan survey has found.""The economy is at a pause but unlikely to fall"", the economy minister said.In the Bank of Japan's December survey, the balance of big manufacturers saying business conditions are better, minus those saying they are worse, was 22, down from 26 in September.Confidence among non-manufacturers was unchanged in the final quarter of 2004, but it is forecast to drop one point in the March survey.""It will feel a bit slower (next year) than this year, and growth may be a bit more gentle but the situation is that the recovery will continue,"" said economy minister Heizo Takenaka.December's confidence level was below that seen in September, the Bank of Japan said.Companies reported they expect to invest 7.7% more in the year to March 2005 than the previous year - up from expectations of 6.1% increase in the September Tankan"
Millions 'to lose textile jobs',"The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market.""The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal,"" Andrew Pendleton, Christian Aid's head of Trade Policy, said.Millions of the world's poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year, a charity has warned.The WTO said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.While the current MFA was not perfect, its did allow Third World countries like Bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, Christian Aid said.The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry.The MFA pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market.It added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade.Some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people"

Fannie Mae 'should restate books',"US mortgage company Fannie Mae should restate its earnings, a move that is likely to put a billion-dollar dent in its accounts, watchdogs have said.The SEC's comments are likely to increase pressure on Congress to strengthen supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The other main US mortgage firm Freddie Mac restated earnings by $5bn (£2.6bn) last year after a probe of its books.Fannie Mae last month warned that some records were incorrect"
US to rule on Yukos refuge call,"Yukos has said a US bankruptcy court will decide whether to block Russia's impending auction of its main production arm on Thursday.Filing for bankruptcy protection in the US was ""a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders, employees and customers,"" said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede.Russian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm's most lucrative asset Yuganskneftegas to help pay a $27bn (£14bn) back tax bill, which they claim is owed by Yukos.Russian authorities are due to auction off Yuganskneftegas on 19 December to pay a huge tax bill sent to Yukos.The Russian oil firm has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US in an attempt to halt the forced sale.Mr Clement said that under Russian law, the Russian government was obliged to enter into arbitration as set out in international law.Yukos asked the Houston court to order Russia to arbitration so that it can press claims for billions of dollars in damages over a ""campaign of illegal, discriminatory and disproportionate"" tax claims"

Bombardier chief to leave company,"Bombardier said restructuring plans drawn up by Mr Tellier's would continue to be implemented.Mr Tellier had indicated he wanted to stay at the world's top train maker and third largest manufacturer of civil aircraft until the restructuring was complete.""I understand the board's concern that I would not be there for the long-term and the need to develop and execute strategies, and the need to reshape the management structure at this time,"" Mr Tellier said in a statement on Monday.Earlier this month the firm said it earned $10m (£19.2m) in the third quarter, down from a profit of $133m a year ago.Under Mr Tellier's tenure at the company, which began in January 2003, plans to cut the worldwide workforce of 75,000 by almost a third by 2006 were announced"
Brazil approves bankruptcy reform,"The new legislation changes this, giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers.According to Andreas Adriano of Latin Trade Magazine, the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds.The old law, dating from 1945, gave priority first to workers, second to tax revenue and finally to creditors.A major reform of Brazil's bankruptcy laws has been approved by the country's Congress, in a move which it is hoped will cut the cost of borrowing.The law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy"

Stormy year for property insurers,"Swiss Re said it had registered about 300 natural and man-made disasters around the world in 2004.The world's second biggest insurer said disasters around the globe have seen property claims reach $42bn (£21.5bn).Tightly packed populations in the areas involved in natural and man-made disasters were to partly to blame for the rise in claims, it said.The damages claimed in 2004 eclipsed previous years, including 2001 when the 11 September attacks pushed claims up to $37bn"
Parmalat sues 45 banks over crash,"Parmalat has sued 45 banks as it tries to reclaim money paid to banks before the scandal-hit Italian dairy company went bust last year.Parmalat has not identified which banks it has gone after this time.The unidentified Parmalat source also told Reuters that the company was planning to take action against a total of 80 financial institutions.Under Italian law, administrators can seek to get back money paid to financial institutions prior to insolvency, if there is a suspicion that the institutions knew that the company was in financial trouble.It has also gone after auditors Grant Thornton.He claims the banks were aware of the problems but continued to work with the company so they could earn commissions"
Irish company hit by Iraqi report,"Reuters news agency reported that Iraq's Oil Ministry has awarded the first post-war oilfield contracts to a Canadian and a Turkish company.The contract to develop the Suba-Luhais field has not yet been awarded as Iraq's Oil Ministry is studying the offers.Shares in Irish oil company Petrel Resources have lost more than 50% of their value on a report that the firm has failed to win a contract in Iraq.If Iraq's cabinet approves the oil ministry's choice of companies, then this will be the first deal that Iraq has signed with a foreign oil company.Ironhorse Oil and Gas has denied to Reuters that it is the company in question.A Canadian company, named IOG, is reported to have won the contract to run the Himrin field"
Yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction,"Yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and Russian law, and said Baikal had bought itself trouble.A little-known Russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant Yukos at auction in Moscow.Meanwhile, Tim Osborne, head of Yukos main shareholders' group Menatep, said that Yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside Russia, against the auction winners.Hours before the auction lawyers for Menatep, a group through which Mr Khodorkovsky and his associates control Yukos, said they would take legal action in other countries.""The company considers that the victor of today's auction has bought itself a serious $9bn headache,"" said Yukos spokesman Alexander Shadrin.However, Gazprom has announced it is not linked to Baikal in any way.Yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but Russian authorities argued they were imposing the law, trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes.""I would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and Gazprom now has a partner.Yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.Baikal paid 260.75bn roubles ($9.37bn: £4.8bn) for Yugansk - nowhere near the $27bn Russia says Yukos owes in taxes.But just two companies turned up for the auction, Gazprom and the unknown Baikal Finance Group, named after a large freshwater lake in Siberia.Reports from Russia say Baikal has paid a deposit of nearly $1.7bn from a Sberbank (Savings Bank) account to the Russian Federal Property Fund, for Yugansk.And, according to Tass news agency, Gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for Baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles.The protection, if recognised by the Russian authorities, would have allowed Yukos' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets"
S&N extends Indian beer venture,"The UK's biggest brewer, Scottish and Newcastle (S&N), is to buy 37.5% of India's United Breweries in a deal worth 4.66bn rupees ($106m:£54.6m).S&N will buy a 17.5% equity stake in United, maker of the well-known Kingfisher lager brand, and make a public offer to buy another 20% stake.In 2002 S&N and United agreed to form a strategic partnership, one that would include a joint venture business and a UK investment in the Indian brewer.Millennium Alcobev will now be merged with United, which expects post-merger to have about half of India's beer market.In addition to the equity stake S&N is to invest 2.47bn rupees in United through non-convertible redeemable preference shares.Meanwhile, United's budget airline, Kingfisher Airlines, is to buy 10 A320 aircraft from Airbus and has the option to buy 20 more aircraft in a deal worth up to $1.8bn"
Euronext 'poised to make LSE bid',"Last week, the LSE rejected a takeover proposal from German rival Deutsche Boerse - the 530 pence-a-share offer valued the exchange at about £1.35bn.Euronext already has a presence in London due to its 2001 acquisition of London-based options and futures exchange Liffe.Last week the LSE said not only was the bid undervalued, but that it had ""been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented"".Trades on the LSE are cleared via Clearnet, in which Euronext has a quarter stake.Pan-European group Euronext is poised to launch a bid for the London Stock Exchange, UK media reports say.Euronext, which also operates an exchange in Lisbon, last week appointed UBS and ABN Amro as additional advisors.While Mr Seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of London, the mayor of Frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost German jobs"
Christmas shoppers flock to tills,"A spokesman for Manchester's Trafford Centre said it was ""the biggest Christmas to date"" with sales up 5%.""I do think this has had a lot to do with reports of lower sales figures,"" she said.""Our sales so far have been 2% up on the same time last year,"" he said.Regent Street Association director Annie Walker said on Saturday: ""The stores were heaving today and a lot of people are going to be doing last minute shopping as many people finished work on Friday and can go in the week.""On Saturday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the St David's Shopping Centre in Cardiff said it looked like being its busiest day of the year with about 200,000 shoppers expected to have visited by the close of play.The Trafford Centre spokeswoman said about 8,500 thousand vehicles had arrived at the centre on Saturday before 1130 GMT.She said reports of a slump in pre-Christmas sales were related to the growing popularity of internet sales.Shops all over the UK reported strong sales on the last Saturday before Christmas with some claiming record-breaking numbers of festive shoppers"
Mystery surrounds new Yukos owner,"The sale has however bought time for Gazprom to raise the money needed for the purchase, analysts said.The sale has destroyed Yukos, once the owner of Yuganskneftegas, said founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky.Gazprom has denied that it is behind the purchase.""It is a front for somebody but not necessarily for Gazprom,"" said Oleg Maximov, an analyst at Troika Dialog in Moscow.""We don't know if this company is linked 100% to Gazprom.""Yuganskneftegas has been sold in the best traditions of the 90s.Russia's newspapers claimed that Baikal was a front for gas monopoly Gazprom, which had been expected to win.Gazprom had been expected to win the auction but is thought to have failed to get finance for the deal after a US court injunction barred it from taking part.It has been hit with more than $27bn in taxes and fines and many observers now say that the break up of the firm that accounts for 20% of Russia's oil output is inevitable"
Euronext joins bid battle for LSE,"Commentators say that a deal with Euronext, which owns the Liffe derivatives exchange in London and combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, could potentially offer the LSE more cost savings than a deal with Deutsche Boerse.Pan-European stock market Euronext has approached the London Stock Exchange (LSE) about a possible takeover bid.The offer follows widespread media speculation that Euronext would make an offer for LSE.However, Euronext said it could not guarantee ""at this stage"" that a firm offer would be made for LSE.Talks with the European stock market and with rival bidder Deutsche Boerse will continue, the LSE said.A weekend report in the Telegraph had quoted an unnamed executive at Euronext as saying the group would make a cash bid to trump Deutsche Boerse's offer"
Iraq and Afghanistan in WTO talks,"There are now 27 countries seeking membership of the WTO.The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to hold membership talks with both Iraq and Afghanistan.But several nations criticised the approach, and European Union ambassador to the WTO, Carlo Trojan, said Iran's application ""must be treated independently of political issues"".Before the process gets under way, all 148 WTO members must give their backing to applicant countries.Membership of the Geneva-based WTO helps guarantee a country's goods receives equal treatment in the markets of other member states - a policy which has seen it become closely associated with globalisation.But Iran's bid to join the trade body has been refused after the US blocked its application for the 21st time"

Tokyo says deflation 'controlled',"He said the consumer price index (CPI) would rise 0.1% in the next fiscal year, the first gain since 2000/01.Deflation - or falling consumer prices - has plagued Japan for more than five years.The Japanese government has forecast that the country's economic growth will slow to 1.6% in the next fiscal year starting in April 2005.While it predicts this fall from the current 2.1% level, it said it was making progress on ending deflation"
No seasonal lift for house market,"The CML said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year-on-year to 85,000 - the lowest total seen since February 2003.CML figures showed gross lending fell by 4% in November as the number of people buying new homes fell.A swathe of figures have provided further evidence of a slowdown in the UK property market.The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), British Bankers Association (BBA) and Building Societies Association (BSA) all said mortgage lending was slowing.Data from the CML showed lending fell to just over £25bn in November, from £25.5bn a year earlier.""What is apparent is a picture of a slowing market, but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole,"" CML director general Michael Coogan said.Rightmove said estate agents were set to enter 2005 with a third more properties on their books than a year ago.A host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in 2005"
Yukos seeks court action on sale,"Yukos will return to a US court on Wednesday to seek sanctions against Baikal Finance Group, the little-known firm which has bought its main asset.Yukos has said it will sue Baikal and others involved in the sale of Yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages.Yukos' US lawyers will attempt to have Baikal assets frozen after the Russian government ignored a US court order last week blocking the sale.Yukos' US lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of US bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction.Yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company.Russian newspapers have claimed that Baikal - which bought the Yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, £4.8bn) on Sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with Surgutneftegas, Russia's fourth-biggest oil producer.Many observers believe that the unit, which produces 60% of Yukos' oil output, could ultimately fall into the hands of Surgutneftegas or even Gazprom, the state gas firm which opted out of the auction"
Indy buys into India paper,"Irish publishing group Independent News & Media is buying up a 26% stake in Indian newspaper company Jagran in a deal worth 25m euros ($34.1m).Meanwhile, the group made no comment about the future of the Independent newspaper despite recent speculation that Sir Anthony had held talks with potential buyers over a stake in the daily publication.""2004 has proven to be an important year for Independent News & Media,"" said chief executive Sir Anthony O'Reilly.Group advertising revenues were up over 10% year-on-year, the group said, with overall circulation revenues are expected to increase almost 10% year-on-year.He has consistently denied suggestions that the Independent and the Independent on Sunday are up for sale.Buy it is understood that the recent success of the smaller edition of the Independent, which has pushed circulation up by 20% to 260,000, has prompted interest from industry rivals, with Daily Mail & General Trust tipped as the most likely suitor"
Senior Fannie Mae bosses resign,"Fannie Mae was criticised by financial regulators and could have to restate its earnings by up to $9bn (£4.6bn).The financial regulator said Fannie Mae would have to raise substantial new capital to restore its balance sheet.The two most senior executives at US mortgage giant Fannie Mae have resigned after accounting irregularities were uncovered at the company.The problems afflicting Fannie Mae are just the latest to hit the US mortgage industry.Recent investigations have exposed extensive accounting errors at Fannie Mae, which supplies funds to America's $8 trillion mortgage market.Although not making loans directly to buyers, Fannie Mae is the largest single player in the mortgage market, underwriting half of all US house purchases.Analysts said the SEC's criticism made it impossible for Fannie Mae's senior executives to remain.Fannie Mae was found to have violated accounting rules relating to derivatives - financial instruments used to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates - and some pre-paid loans"
Cannabis hopes for drug firm,"A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.""We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,"" said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS.The UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes.A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits.But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval"
Bush to get 'tough' on deficit,"Mr Bush, however, has said the best way to halt the dollar's slide is to deal with the US deficit.US president George W Bush has pledged to introduce a ""tough"" federal budget next February in a bid to halve the country's deficit in five years.""We will submit a budget that fits the times,"" Mr Bush said.The US budget and its trade deficit are both deep in the red, helping to push the dollar to lows against the euro and fuelling fears about the economy.Mr Bush indicated there would be ""strict discipline"" on non-defence spending in the budget"
House prices drop as sales slow,"House prices fell further in November and property sale times lengthened as rate rises took their toll, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors found.The figures were published as another survey by property website Rightmove said the average asking price of a home fell by more than £600 from £190,329 in November to £189,733 in December.A total of 48% of chartered surveyor estate agents reported lower prices in the three months to November - the highest level in 12 years.Around the UK, the Midlands and South saw the biggest price falls, while London prices fell but at less than the national rate.""The slowdown occurring in the market has given buyers more power to negotiate, but this time of year is traditionally a quiet one,"" RICS housing spokesman Ian Perry said.In Scotland, where prices have remained on an upward path, increases were more ""moderate"", RICS added"
Fresh hope after Argentine crisis,"Mr Valentine, who was born in the United States but grew up in Argentina, was fortunate: At the time of the crisis, his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad.""Three years ago, every sector [of the economy] was hit by the crisis,"" said entrepreneur Drayton Valentine.Three years after Argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis, there is fresh hope.Mr Valentine, who was born in the United States but grew up in Argentina, agreed.""The situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in Argentina, "" said Carlos Baez Silva, president of AARA, an association that represents bank account and bond holders.Argentina was on the brink of collapse.Few people have recovered more than about half their savings, Mr Baez Silva estimated, pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government, people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe.""Everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the Argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached,"" he said.The debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which, at least initially, was made worse by the government's decisions.Argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in 2001 culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors.""Locally there is a sense of recovery, many companies are exporting now,"" he said, noting that a lot of firms, which were closed during the crisis, are re-opening.Argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of 2001.The affair has made Mr Baez Silva disillusioned with the country's legal system.It really was dire.The fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the peso's decade-long peg to the US dollar in February 2002.""The Argentine authorities are proud, should be proud, of the strong performance of the economy,"" Thomas Dawson, an IMF director, said earlier this month.""Agriculture and tourism are helping,"" said entrepreneur Drayton Valentine.""If I have to save pesos [the local currency] there is not much problem, but I will think twice before I deposit dollars in a bank"""
Disney settles disclosure charges,"The SEC also found that Disney did not disclose that a 50% Disney-owned subsidiary company - Lifetime - employed the wife of current Disney director John Bryson, and that she earned more than $1m a year.Disney also failed to disclose payments to Air Shamrock, an airline owned by Mr Gold and fellow former Disney directors Roy Disney.Walt Disney has settled charges from US federal regulators that it failed to disclose how family members of directors were employed by the company.Disney failed to tell investors that between 1999 and 2001 it employed three adult children of three then directors.The three Disney directors in question in the central matter of the SEC's investigation - Reveta Bowers, Stanley Gold and Raymond Watson - have all since left the company, with Ms Bowers and Mr Watson both retiring, and Mr Gold quitting in 2003"
Putin backs state grab for Yukos,"Lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because Yukos - with an office in Houston - had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of US law which has worldwide jurisdiction.Russia's president has defended the purchase of Yukos' key production unit by state-owned oil firm Rosneft, saying it followed free market principles.It has said it will be seeking damages of $20bn.The Rosneft announcement came just hours after Yukos accused Gazprom of illegally taking part in Sunday's auction.Gazprom, the company originally tipped to buy Yuganskneftegas, was banned from taking part in the auction by a US court injunction.By selling the Yukos unit to little-known Baikal and then to Rosneft, Russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines, analysts said.A Rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a ""balanced, national energy corporation.""Further muddying the waters is a merger between Rosneft and Gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned.""Everything was done by market methods,"" Mr Putin said at his year-end press conference in Moscow.The latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed Yukos, one of Russia's biggest companies to the brink of collapse.Vladimir Putin said it was quite within the rights of a state-owned company to ensure its interests were met.""The Russian government has sovereign immunity."
Troubled Marsh under SEC scrutiny,"The US stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker Marsh & McLennan's shareholder transactions, the firm has said.Marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the SEC investigation.Marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the New York attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market.Since that inquiry was launched in October, Marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board.Prosecutors allege that Marsh - the world's biggest insurance broker - and other US insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover.The uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch - to downgrade Marsh in recent weeks"
US firm pulls out of Iraq,"""Members of the joint venture including Contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts, are actively working in Iraq and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country,"" it said in a statement.US firms and their workers have been targets of attacks, and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in Iraq.A US company has pulled out of a major contract to rebuild Iraq's transport system after attacks on reconstruction efforts, Pentagon officials have said.Lt Col Eric Schnaible of the PCO told the Associated Press news agency Contrack's withdrawal from the transportation contract was a ""mutually agreed-to separation"" and did not indicate a movement by US companies to leave Iraq.Contrack said ""the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner"""

Banker loses sexism claim,"Merrill Lynch denied Ms Villalba's claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent.Ms Villalba, the former head of Merrill's private client business in Europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal.The tribunal decided that Ms Villalba had been unfairly dismissed because, having been removed from a senior post, she was entitled to wait to see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation.Merrill said Ms Villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit.""Ms Villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman.The firm had told the tribunal that Ms Villalba's division had been losing about $1m a week.The tribunal upheld Ms Villalba's claim of victimisation on certain specific issues, including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract, but said it found no evidence of ""laddish culture"" at the bank.""We said from the start that this case was about performance not gender,"" Merrill said in a statement"
Building giant in asbestos payout,"In 2001, the company set up a fund to compensate asbestos victims, but it later admitted the fund was running short of money.The move follows angry protests after the firm said a previous compensation fund was running out of money.The landmark deal could see thousands of people suffering from lung diseases - caused by asbestos the company once made - receive compensation.However, the deal still has to receive the approval of Hardie's shareholders.In September, the inquiry found that the company had misled the public about the amount of money set aside to cover its asbestos-related liabilities, sparking the resignation of its then chief executive, Peter MacDonald.Hardie, which currently makes more than 80% of its revenues in the US, was once Australia's biggest supplier of asbestos building materials.Australian building products group James Hardie has agreed to pay $1.1bn (£568m) to victims of asbestos-related diseases"
Police detain Chinese milk bosses,"Chinese police have detained three top executives at milk firm Yili, with reports suggesting that they are being investigated for embezzlement.Analysts wondered if the scandal at Yili - the latest to befall Chinese companies this year - could be followed by further revelations of corporate wrongdoing.A Yili spokesman said it may now move to oust chairman Zheng Junhuai.Yili - full name Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial - confirmed its chairman, chief financial officer and securities representative were all in custody.Yili has recently been the subject of intense media speculation over its financial operations"
India's Deccan seals $1.8bn deal,"India's government has given its backing to cheaper and more accessible air travel.When it was set up the firm offered tickets that were 50% cheaper than other Indian airlines.Air Deccan has ordered 30 Airbus A320 planes in a $1.8bn (£931m) deal as India's first low-cost airline expands in the fast-growing domestic market.Beer magnate Vijay Mallya recently set up Kingfisher Airlines, while UK entrepreneur Richard Branson has said he is keen to start a local operation.Air Deccan was set up last year and wants to lure travellers away from the railway network and pricier rivals.The potential of the Indian market has attracted attention at home and abroad"
Venezuela and China sign oil deal,"Venezuela has also offered to supply 120,000 barrels of fuel oil a month to China.China has been a net importer of oil since the mid 1990's with more than a third of the oil and gas it consumes coming from abroad.China's quick-growing economy's need for oil has contributed to record-high oil prices this year, along with political unrest in the Middle East and supply bottlenecks.Mr Chavez, who is visiting China, said his country would put its many of its oil facilities at the disposal of China.Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez has offered China wide-ranging access to the country's oil reserves.The offer, made as part of a trade deal between the two countries, will allow China to operate oil fields in Venezuela and invest in new refineries"
Jarvis sells Tube stake to Spain,"Shares in engineering group Jarvis have soared more than 16% on news that it is offloading its stake in London underground consortium Tube Lines.The sale of the 33% stake to Spain's Ferrovial for £146m ($281m) is a lifeline to Jarvis, which was weighed down by debts of more than £230m.Jarvis said the sale, which raked in more than the £100m analysts had expected, would ""substantially"" enhance its financial position.Shares in Jarvis were up more than 16% to 18 pence by the close of trade on Friday.Jarvis wants to scale back the division, which has proved too costly and has been blamed for many of its problems"
Honda wins China copyright ruling,"Japan's Honda has won a copyright case in Beijing, further evidence that China is taking a tougher line on protecting intellectual property rights.Earlier this week China said that in future it will punish violators of intellectual property rights with up to seven years in jail.Last month the EU said it will start monitoring China, Ukraine and Russia to ensure they are going after pirated goods.Between 1998 and 2002, the number of counterfeit or pirated goods intercepted at the EU's external borders increased by more than 800%, it said.Despite the fact that product piracy is a major problem, foreign companies have only occasionally won cases and the compensation awarded has usually been small.The problem of piracy is not limited to China, however, and the potential for profit is huge.Other firms that have taken legal action in China, with varying degrees of success, include Yamaha, General Motors and Toyota"
Air Jamaica back in state control,"The Jamaican government is regaining control of Air Jamaica in an bid to help the ailing company out of its financial difficulties.In common with many carriers, Air Jamaica, with debts of $560m (£291m), has been hit by high fuel costs and the impact of the 11 September attacks.""The administration is committed to a viable national airline that will serve as a major catalyst for our economy,"" said Finance Minister Omar Davies"
Battered dollar hits another low,"The dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the US economy.Thursday's new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the US had fallen 12% in November - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity.The dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded about $1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the US trade and budget deficits.Meanwhile, France's finance minister has said the world faced ""economic catastrophe"" unless the US worked with Europe and Asia on currency controls.The official US policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters.The US government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from ""abnormal and dangerous heights"" set in 2002.Ministers from European and Asian governments have recently called on the US to strengthen the dollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies"
Quake's economic costs emerging,"The tragedy has left at least 25,000 people dead, with Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and Indonesia worst hit.Analysts said that figure is likely to rise and the country's tourist industry is likely to be hardest hit.World Bank president James Wolfensohn has said his agency is ""only beginning to grasp the magnitude of the disaster"" and its economic impact.In Sri Lanka, some observers have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost.Malaysia said as many as 1,000 fishermen will be affected and that damage to the industry will be ""significant"", Agence France Presse reported.""In three months, we should rebuild 70% of the damage in the three worst hit provinces,"" said Juthamas Siriwan, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand.""The economic impact of it will certainly be large, but it should not be enough to derail the momentum of the region in 2005,"" he said.The outlook for Sri Lanka is less optimistic, with analysts predicting that the country's tourist industry will struggle to recovery quickly.Economists believe several of the 10 countries hit by the giant waves could see a slowdown in growth.The regional giant has enjoyed strong growth in 2004"
Disaster claims 'less than $10bn',"The impact on US insurance companies is not expected to be heavy, analysts said.Rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries, and many of those affected will not have insurance, analysts said.Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, said that its exposure is less than 100m euros (£70m; $136m).Swiss Re has said total claims are likely to be less than $10bn (£5.17bn).Many of the affected countries, such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka or the Maldives, do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters, said a US-based insurance expert.Allianz, a leading German insurer, said it did not know yet what its exposure would be.It's more likely the Bermuda-based reinsurance [companies] might have some exposure,"" said Paul Newsome, an insurance analyst at AG Edwards & Co.Zurich Financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster.Munich Re and Swiss Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, have said exposure will be less than for other disasters.Insured damage could be a fraction of the ""billions of dollars worth of destruction in Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Indonesia, the Maldive Islands and Malaysia,"" said Prudential Equity Group insurance analyst Jay Gelb.""US insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure.Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia and Thailand, at about $5bn (£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered to Central America after Hurricane Mitch.However, it said the tidal waves were unlikely to have a ""significant"" impact on its business.Most US insurers have relatively little exposure to Asia and those that do, pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds"
India-Pakistan peace boosts trade,"The value of trade in April-July rose to $186.3m (£97m) from $64.4m in the same period in 2003, the Indian Government said.""If the positive trend continues, two-way trade could well cross half a billion dollars this fiscal year,"" India's federal commerce Minister Kamal Nath said.Calmer relations between India and Pakistan are paying economic dividends, with new figures showing bilateral trade up threefold in the summer.According to official data, the value of India's overall exports in the current fiscal year is expected to reach more than $60bn, while in Pakistan's case it is set to hit more than $12bn.Meanwhile, the Indian Government said the prospects for the country's booming economy remained ""very bright"" despite a ""temporary aberration"" this year"
US to probe airline travel chaos,"Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month.There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations.The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.US Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports.Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair.US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials.Staff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered.US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs.Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues"
S Korean lender faces liquidation,"""Creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against LG Group if LG Card is liquidated,"" said Yoo Ji-chang, governor of Korean Development Bank (KDB) - one of the card firm's major creditors.LG Card's creditors have given LG group until Wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package.LG Card's creditors have threatened parent group LG Group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.""LG Group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of LG Card,"" said Kim Yungmin, an equity strategist at Dongwon Investment Trust Management.LG Group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits.LG Group has said any package should reflect the firm's new ownership, and it will not accept an unfair burden.Creditors of South Korea's top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out"
Dollar hits new low versus euro,"The US dollar has continued its record-breaking slide and has tumbled to a new low against the euro.The US is struggling with a ballooning trade deficit and analysts said one of the easiest ways to fund it was by allowing a depreciation of the dollar.The dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded about $1.20 against the euro.The US currency was trading at $1.364 per euro at 1800 GMT on Monday.Investors are betting that the European Central Bank (ECB) will not do anything to weaken the euro, while the US is thought to favour a declining dollar"
Mild winter drives US oil down 6%,"US oil prices have fallen by 6%, driven down by forecasts of a mild winter in the densely populated northeast.Statistics released last week showed that stockpiles of oil products in the US had risen, an indication that severe supply disruptions may not arise this winter, barring any serious incident.Oil prices have broken records in 2004, topping $50 a barrel at one point, driven up by a welter of worries about unrest in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, rising demand and supply bottlenecks.Light crude oil futures fell $2.86 to $41.32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), and have now lost $4 in five days.Nonetheless, US crude is still 30% more expensive than at the beginning of 2004, boosted by growing demand and bottlenecks at refineries"
Share boost for feud-hit Reliance,"The board of Indian conglomerate Reliance has agreed a share buy-back, to counter the effects of a power struggle in the controlling family.The company has been fractious since founder Dhirubhai Ambani died in 2002, leaving no will.The buy-back is a victory for chairman Mukesh Ambani, whose idea it was"
Giant waves damage S Asia economy,"Other countries also are reported to have pledged cash, while the US State Department said it was examining what aid was needed in the region.Other agencies, such as the Asian Development Bank, have said that it is too early to comment on the amount of aid needed.Growth has been rapid in southeast Asia, with the World Tourism Organisation figures showing a 45% increase in tourist revenues in the region during the first 10 months of 2004.""I should assume, however, that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the US,"" he said.The European Union has said it will deliver 3m euros (£2.1m; $4.1m) of aid, according to the Wall Street Journal.Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed at about $5bn (£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered Central America after Hurricane Mitch.Tourism is a vital part of the economies of the stricken countries, providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east Asian region, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).""India continues to post excellent results thanks to increased promotion and product development, but also to the upsurge in business travel driven by the rapid economic development of the country,"" the WTO said.The EU's Humanitarian Aid Commissioner, Louis Michel, was quoted as saying that it was key to bring aid ""in those vital hours and days immediately after the disaster"".Governments, aid agencies, insurers and travel firms are among those counting the cost of the massive earthquake and waves that hammered southern Asia.Mitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998.December and January are two of the busiest months for the travel in southern Asia and the damage will be even more keenly felt as the industry was only just beginning to emerge from a post 9/11 slump.Only Sri Lanka and Bangladesh currently receive IMF support, while Indonesia, the quake's epicentre, has recently graduated from IMF assistance.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope.Tourism also brings in much needed foreign currency.""Arrivals to other destinations such as... Maldives and Sri Lanka also thrived.""Allianz has said it sees no significant impact on its profitability"
Asia shares defy post-quake gloom,"In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman.But Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs on Wednesday, suggesting that investors do not fear a major economic impact.The full economic costs of the disaster remain unclear.He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars.Thailand has become the first of the 10 southern Asian nations battered by giant waves at the weekend to cut its economic forecast.Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m.""Our nation is in peril here,"" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman.But it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense,"" said ABN Amro chief Asian strategist Eddie Wong.Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday.Thailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.However, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact.In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost"
Israeli economy picking up pace,"The main driver of the faster-than-expected expansion has been exports, with tourism seeing a strong rebound, the statistical office said.Imports gained by 13%, signalling that domestic demand has picked up again.The outlook is better than it has been for a number of years, analysts said.In 2003, the economy expanded by 1.3%The economy is benefiting from a quieter period in Palestinian-Israeli violence and a pick-up in global demand for technology products"
S Korea spending boost to economy,"""The focus will be on job creation and economic recovery, given that unfavourable domestic and global conditions are likely to dog the Korean economy in 2005,"" the ministry said.""Given the economic spill over and employment effect in the construction sector, a sharp downturn in the construction industry could have other adverse effects,"" the ministry said.""Internal and external economic conditions are likely to remain unfavourable in 2005,"" the Finance and Economy Ministry said in a statement.In 2004, growth will be between 4.7% and 4.8%, the ministry said.South Korea will boost state spending next year in an effort to create jobs and kick start its sputtering economy.The government has set an economic growth rate target of 5% for next year and hinted that would be in danger unless it took action.As a result, South Korea will give private companies also will be given the chance to build schools, hospitals, houses and other public buildings.As part of its spending plans, the government said it will ask firms to ""roll over mortgage loans that come due in the first half of 2005"" "

Deutsche attacks Yukos case,"Deutsche Bank contends Yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in Texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the 19 December auction of its top unit by the Russian government, which was in a tax dispute with Yukos.German investment bank Deutsche Bank has challenged the right of Yukos to claim bankruptcy protection in the US.Yukos is confident of its right to US bankruptcy protection, and ""we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again,"" he said.But the US bankruptcy court judge in Texas granted Yukos an injunction that barred Gazprom and its lenders from taking part.In its filing, Deutsche Bank said Houston was ""a jurisdiction in which Yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations.""Yukos has said it intends to seek $20bn in damages from the buyer of Yuganskneftegas once the sale finally goes through.It also said the US bankruptcy court should not become involved in ""a tax dispute between the Federation and one of its corporate citizens"".Deutsche Bank claimed Yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset"
GM in crunch talks on Fiat future,"Fiat claims that GM is legally obliged to buy the 90% of the car unit it does not already own; GM says the contract, signed in 2000, is no longer valid.""Fiat may be willing to cancel the 'put' in exchange for money.""Fiat will meet car giant General Motors (GM) on Tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement over the future of the Italian firm's loss-making auto group.However, GM argues that a Fiat share sale made last year, which cut GM's holding to 10%, together with asset sales made by Fiat have terminated the agreement.""As far as we are aware, the Agnelli family, which indirectly controls at least 30% of Fiat, has not given a firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business.In recent weeks, Fiat has reiterated its claims that this 'put' is still valid and legally binding"

WMC says Xstrata bid is too low,"Grant Samuel said its valuation of WMC was based on lower average prices for nickel, copper and uranium than current market levels.Last month Australia's competition watchdog said it would not oppose the purchase of WMC by Zurich and London-based Xstrata.He said the valuation would put increased pressure on Xstrata to look at ""sweetening"" its offer.WMC Resources is the world's third-largest producer of concentrated nickel, and also a miner of copper and uranium.Australian mining firm WMC Resources has said it is worth up to 30% more than a hostile 7.4bn Australian dollar ($5.8bn; £3bn) bid by rival Xstrata.Analysts said the defence documents provided more details on WMC, and may trigger a possible rival bid.On Tuesday, WMC chairman Tommie Bergman said in a statement the directors believed it was in shareholders' best interest to reject the offer.He said WMC would pursue ""value-creating options"" provided by a portfolio of ""world class assets"""

Warning over US pensions deficit,"With the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) some £23bn (£12m) in deficit, the Financial Economists Roundtable (FER) wants Congress to act.The company has an estimated $2.9bn hole in its pilots' pension scheme, which the PBGC will now guarantee.The FER says firms should not have been allowed to reduce the insurance premiums they pay into the PBGC fund.""With a little firmer hand on the pensions issues in the US, I think that Congress could avoid having to turn to the taxpayer and instead turn the obligations back onto the companies that deserve to pay them,"" said Professor Dennis Logue, dean of Price College of Business at the University of Oklahoma.Instead of taxpayers having to pick up the bill, the FER wants Congressmen to change the PBGC's funding rules"

Singapore growth at 8.1% in 2004,"However, a slower-than-expected fourth quarter points to more modest growth for the trade-driven economy in 2005 as global technology demand falls back.The economy's poor performance in the July to September period followed four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth as Singapore bounced back strongly from the effects of the deadly Sars virus in 2003.The advance, the second-fastest in Asia after China, was led by growth of 13.1% in the key manufacturing sector.""I am surprised at the weak fourth quarter number.That was up from the third quarter, when it fell 3.0%, but was well below analyst forecasts"
Madagascar completes currency switch,"Madagascar has completed the replacement of its Malagasy franc with a new currency, the ariary.The ariary was the name of a pre-colonial currency in the Indian Ocean island state.The phasing out of the franc, begun in July 2003, was intended to distance the country from its past under French colonial rule and address the problem of the large amount of counterfeit francs in circulation.From Monday, all prices and contracts will have to be quoted in the ariary, which was trading at 1,893 to the US dollar"

Ban on forced retirement under 65,"Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said people would not be forced to work longer than they wanted, saying the default age was not a statutory, compulsory retirement age.But Age Concern said imposing a retirement age of 65 was ""cowardly"" and a ""complete u-turn"".Under new European age discrimination rules, a default retirement age of 65 will be introduced.The decision will have no impact on the age at which workers can collect their state pension, the government has said.""This makes a mockery of the Government's so-called commitment to outlawing ageism, leaving the incoming age discrimination law to unravel,"" said Gordon Lishman, director general of Age Concern England .Under age discrimination proposals from the Department of Trade and Industry last year workers were to be allowed to work on till 70 if they wished"

Tsunami to cost Sri Lanka $1.3bn,"Sri Lanka faces a $1.3bn (£691m) bill in 2005 for reconstruction after the tsunami which killed more than 30,000 of its people, its central bank says.A full reckoning of the economic cost to Sri Lanka of the tsunami will not be clear for some time to come.According to Mr Mendis, half the IMF support could come from a freeze on debt repayments, which would free up resources immediately.This estimate is preliminary, bank governor Sunil Mendis told reporters, and could rise in 2006.The bank has 5bn rupees ($50m; £27m) set aside to lend at a lower interest rate to those who lost property.One side-effect of the disaster has been that the value of the rupee has risen as foreign funds have flooded into the country"
Indian oil firm eyes Yukos assets,"State-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk and Russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm.India's biggest oil exploration firm, Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos.Local press had reported that ONGC was looking to buy 15% of Yukos' former key oil production unit for $2bn (£1bn).India produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood.India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies.Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US.""For countries to develop, they have to have access to energy,"" said John Westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood.By buying into Yugansk, ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf states for oil imports, Mr Westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India are slim.India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption.""We are in touch with the concerned Russian entities about the Yukos assets and other opportunities in Russia,"" said ONGC chairman Subir Raha.At the same time, India's economy is booming and the country's thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.ONGC's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world's biggest oil producers brought to its knees"

WorldCom bosses' $54m payout,"""None of the 10 former directors was a direct participant in the accounting machinations of the WorldCom fraud,"" said the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).Ten former directors at WorldCom have agreed to pay $54m (£28.85m), including $18m from their own pockets, to settle a class action lawsuit, reports say.Corporate governance experts said that if the directors do dip into their own pockets for the settlement, it will set a new standard for the accountability of bosses, when the firms they oversee face problems.""Directors very rarely pay,"" said Charles Elson, chairman of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.Two other outside former directors, Bert Roberts and Francesco Galesi, remain defendants in the lawsuit, said the newspaper.It has not yet been determined how much each director will have to pay.But, a spokesman for the prosecutor, New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi, said no formal agreement had been made"

Mixed Christmas for US retailers,"Upscale department store Nordstrom said same store sales were 9.3% higher than during the same period last year.Accessory vendor Claire's Stores also suffered as an expected last minute shopping rush never materialised, leaving its same store sales 5% higher, compared to a 6% rise last year.Overall, December sales are forecast to rise by 4.5% to $220bn - less than the 5.1% increase seen a year earlier.But Wal-Mart only saw its sales rise after it cut prices.Jeweller Zale also felt little Christmas cheer with December sales down 0.7% on the same month last year.And for stores that have been doing well over the last several months, December was a good month.""The company saw a 3% rise in December sales, less than the 4.3% rise seen a year earlier.One discount retailer to fare well in December was Costco Wholesale, which continued a recent run of upbeat results with a better-than-expected 8% jump in same store sales.However, experts added that if prices had not been cut across the sector, Christmas sales - which account for nearly 23% of annual retail sales - would have been far worse.US retailers posted mixed results for December - with luxury retailers faring well while many others were forced to slash prices to lift sales"

UK bank seals South Korean deal,"UK-based bank Standard Chartered said it would spend $3.3bn (£1.8bn) to buy one of South Korea's main retail banks.The move, a year after Citigroup beat Standard Chartered to buy Koram bank, would be the South Korean financial sector's biggest foreign takeover.Standard Chartered said KFB was a ""well-managed, conservatively run bank with a highly skilled workforce"" and represented a ""significant acquisition in a growth market"".Some analysts also queried whether Standard Chartered had overpaid for KFB.Standard Chartered said acquiring Korea First Bank (KFB) fulfilled a strategic objective of building a bigger presence in Asia's third largest economy.Standard Chartered expects about 16% of future group revenue to come from KFB.This time around, Standard Chartered is thought to have beaten HSBC to the deal.KFB is South Korea's seventh largest bank, with 3 million retail customers, 6% of the country's banking market and an extensive branch network.Standard Chartered said it was buying 100% of KFB, an agreement that would bring an end to the bank's complex dual ownership.HSBC will now have to wait for the next South Korean bank in line to be sold off - thought likely to be Korea Exchange Bank, also currently in the hands of a US group.Standard Chartered sees ""the opportunity to create value by the introduction of more sophisticated banking products"".The deal, which requires regulatory approval, is expected to be completed by April 2005 and to be earnings accretive in 2006, Standard Chartered said.Standard Chartered has its headquarters in London but does two thirds of its business in Asia, and much of the rest in Africa"

Tsunami cost hits Jakarta shares,"On Friday, the government said its five-year estimate of rebuilding costs for Banda Aceh province - much of which was flattened by the quake and the tsunami - was 20 trillion rupiah ($2.2bn; £1.1bn), twice what it had previously estimated.On Monday, Indonesian economy minister Aburizal Bakrie told reporters that the Paris Club group of creditor countries was expected to freeze 20-30bn rupiah in payments due in 2005 and 2006.The fall came as Indonesia said it expected debt repayments of up to 30 trillion rupiah ($3.2bn; £1.7bn) to be frozen to help pay for the recovery.The stock market in Jakarta has seen its biggest slide in a month, after the country doubled the likely cost of rebuilding from the Asian tsunami.French finance minister Herve Gaymard said on Sunday that the Paris Club had already agreed to a moratorium on repayments for tsunami-hit countries ahead of its meeting on 12 January"
Iran budget seeks state sell-offs,"Continued obstruction of foreign investment could get in the way not only of privatisation plans, but also of Mr Khatami's hope of modestly reducing the government's reliance on oil revenues.In contrast, oil revenues were expected to fall to $14.1bn from $16bn in the year to March 2005.In an address to the Majlis, Mr Khatami predicted economic growth of 7.1% in 2005-6, up from 6.7% in the current year.Mr Khatami's second term as president ends on 1 August, making this his last budget.""Current government expenditure should come from tax revenues,"" Mr Khatami said.Late last year, they backed a law which would give parliament a veto over foreign investment.Mr Khatami has already been blocked by parliament from reducing the subsidies on many products including bread and petrol, reducing his room to manoeuvre"
EC calls truce in deficit battle,"The European Commission (EC) has called a truce in its battle with France and Germany over breaching deficit limits.After announcing its decision to erase France and Germany from its list of deficit rule breakers, the EU said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that 2005 should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget's below 3%.The forecasts are based on EC predictions of GDP growth of 1.5% in Germany next year and 2.2% in France.France and Germany will breach that this year.""The commission concludes that the two countries appear to be on track to correct their excessive deficits by 2005,"" it said in a statement.The move came after France and Germany vowed to run their budget deficits below the EU cap in 2005 - for the first time in four years.Under EU rules, member countries must keep their deficits below 3%.The EU expects the German deficit to fall to fall to 2.9% of GDP next year from 3.9% this year, while France's is forecast to drop to 3% from an expected 3.7% this year"

Steady job growth continues in US,"Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy.Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election.The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.""Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.""While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said.The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop"

$1m payoff for former Shell boss,"Shell is to pay $1m (£522,000) to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in April 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves.Despite receiving an email from Mr Van de Vijver which said the firm had ""fooled"" the market about its reserves, the investigation said, she did nothing to inquire further.Shell said the pay-off was in line with Ms Boynton's contract.In all, Shell restated its reserves four times during 2003.The revelation that Shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman, Sir Phil Watts, and production chief Walter van der Vijver"
India and Iran in gas export deal,"Iran - Opec's second-biggest oil producer and one of the world's top gas producers - has been pursuing a series of deals, rewarding LNG buyers with participation in development of its oil fields.India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption.India has signed a $40bn (£21bn) deal to import millions of tonnes of liquefied natural gas from Iran.Firms led by the Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will also assist in the development of Iranian oil fields.ONGC and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) reached a preliminary deal for Indian firms to take part in the development of the Yadavaran and Jufeyr oilfields, both countries said in a statement"
LSE 'sets date for takeover deal',"A £1.3bn offer from Deutsche Boerse has already been rejected, while Euronext has said it will make an all cash bid.Both Deutsche Boerse and rival Euronext held talks with the London market last week over a possible offer.However, the Sunday Telegraph report added that there are signs that Deutsche Boerse chief executive Werner Seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the LSE's managed bid process.Speculation suggests that Paris-based Euronext has the facilities in place to make a bid of £1.4bn, while its German rival may up its bid to the £1.5bn mark.The newspaper also claimed Mr Seifert was becoming ""increasingly frustrated"" with the pace of negotiations since Deutsche Boerse's £1.3bn offer was rejected in mid-December, in particular the LSE's decision to suspend talks over the Christmas period.Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful"
News Corp makes $5.4bn Fox offer,"Under the terms of the offer, minority Fox shareholders will receive 1.90 News Corp shares in return for each Fox share they hold.News Corp shares fell 25 cents to $17.65 after the share offer was announced while Fox shares were up 19 cents at $31.22.Analysts said the decision to list News Corp in the US - which will result in the firm's shares trading in New York rather than Sydney- nullified the need to retain a separate stock market listing for Fox Entertainment shares.News Corporation is seeking to buy out minority investors in Fox Entertainment Group, its broadcasting subsidiary, for about $5.4bn (£3.7bn)"
Israel looks to US for bank chief,"Mr Fischer will face a delicate balancing act - both in political and economic terms - between Mr Sharon and finance minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who also backed his nomination.But his appointment has also raised hopes that it could bring in fresh investment - and perhaps even an improvement in the country's credit rating Mr Fischer first went to Israel for six months in 1973, and almost emigrated there before deciding finally to return to the US.Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of banking giant Citigroup, has agreed to take the Bank of Israel job subject to approval from parliament and cabinet.Israel has asked a US banker and former International Monetary Fund director to run its central bank.Mr Fischer, who speaks fluent Hebrew, will have to become an Israeli citizen to take the job"
EU-US seeking deal on air dispute,"Both sides hope to reach a negotiated deal over state aid received by European aircraft maker Airbus and its US rival Boeing, Mr Mandelson said.""With this agreement the EU and US have confirmed their willingness to resolve the dispute which has arisen between them,"" Mr Mandelson said.The US filed a complaint against Brussels with the WTO over state aid to Airbus, prompting a retaliatory EU complaint over US support for Boeing.The EU and US have agreed to begin talks on ending subsidies given to aircraft makers, EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson has announced.Mr Mandelson said the EU and US hoped to avoid having to resolve the dispute at the World Trade Organisation (WTO).Separately, the world's largest package delivery company, UPS, said it had placed an order for 10 Airbus A380 superjumbo freight-carrying jets, with an option to buy 10 more of the triple-decker aircraft.However, UPS said it was cutting a previous order for smaller Airbus A300s from 90 planes to 53"
Nortel in $300m profit revision,"""With the completion of our restatements we have a solid foundation on which to move forward with our business,"" said Nortel president and chief executive Bill Owens.Nortel added: ""these members of the core executive team share the board's deep disappointment over the circumstances that led to the restatement.""Telecoms equipment maker Nortel Networks has sharply revised downwards its profits for the 2003 fiscal year.Nortel also issued new figures for the 2001-2002 period, which they had previously indicated had understated losses.In a long-awaited filing, Nortel said it had made $434m (£231m), compared to the previously reported $732m"
Minister hits out at Yukos sale,"""The task is not simply to double GDP; instead it is to use GDP to qualitatively improve people's lives,"" Mr Gref told Kommersant.Economy minister German Gref told the Kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was ""unjustified"".And he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like Yukos - a technique now being applied by the Kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake.The privatisation of companies such as Yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled, he said.Mr Gref also poured cold water on President Putin's promises of doubled economic growth within a decade.His comments follow the sale of much of oil giant Yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm's assets into public ownership.The assault on Yukos' assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months.Yuganskneftegaz, the unit which produced 60% of Yukos' output, had been seized and sold in December for less than $10bn to a previously unknown firm called Baikal.Mr Gref, a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market, was keen to distance himself from Mr Iliaronov's comments"
Chinese exports rise 25% in 2004,"The US's overall trade deficit with China was $124bn in 2003, and is expected to rise to about $150bn for 2004.State Administration of Taxation head Xie Xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; £165bn).According to the Ministry of Commerce, China's exports totalled $63.8bn in December, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn.The increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004, according to Mr Xie.The figures released by the Ministry of Commerce come as China's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row.With imports rising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn"
Karachi stocks hit historic high,"Mr Lakhani feels that the market has risen on the basis of solid economic growth and its current level rests on sound foundations.The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) has recorded its largest single day gain, surging 3.5% to a new high.In 2002, the KSE was the world's best performing stock market, with the index rising 112%.Pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms, two of the strongest sectors in Pakistan, draw some of the Arab money to the KSE.Then, say analysts, there is corporate profitability in the current fiscal year, which has gone up by 27% from last year.The KSE index closed at 6709.93 - an overall gain of nearly 400 points in the first two trading days of the week.""Coupled with the 7% GDP growth expected by June this year, I am least surprised at the market's performance,"" says Mr Lakhani.One leading Karachi broker said the real reasons may be political.Most importantly, say analysts, the failure of talks between India and Pakistan on the Baglihar dam in Indian-administered Kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions.A lot of Arab money, he says, has already gone to Malaysia and Indonesia.Locally, too, say analysts, recent political developments have worked to the market's advantage.Analysts argue that a steady improvement in Pakistan's credit ratings by international credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in the market"
US trade gap ballooned in October,"The US trade deficit widened by more than expected in October, hitting record levels after higher oil prices raised import costs, figures have shown  The trade shortfall was $55.5bn (£29bn), up 9% from September, the Commerce Department said.A weaker dollar also increased the cost of imports, though this should help drive export demand in coming months.The trade deficit and the shortfall with China ""are big issues going forward"".Imports rose by 3.4%, while exports increased by only 0.6%.That pushed the 10 month deficit to $500.5bn.The US imported almost $20bn worth of goods from China during October, exporting a little under $3bn"
US prepares for hybrid onslaught,"Ford, which has sold 4,000 of its first hybrid since its launch in August, is bringing a hybrid SUV - the Mariner - to market a year ahead of schedule, with plans for three more models by 2008.Honda has three hybrids on the market, and between them the two Japanese carmakers sold more than 80,000 units last year.GM has a hybrid pickup on the market and is showing two concept SUVs in Detroit.Nissan has bought Toyota's hybrid technology, but plans to bring out its first model only in 2006.""We will not be surprised by any acceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market.""And some watchers point out that the price tag on a hybrid - upwards of $3,000 above that of an equivalent normal-engined car, and suspicion of the technology - may still cool its attraction.Sales of hybrid cars in the US are set to double in 2005, research suggests.Carmakers are starting to build hybrid sports utility vehicles (SUVs), the four-wheel-drive vehicles which now dominate the US car market"
Mitsubishi in Peugeot link talks,"Trouble-hit Mitsubishi Motors is in talks with French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen about a possible alliance.On Tuesday Mitsubishi, the only major Japanese car firm in the red, confirmed earlier reports of negotiations.But a spokesman refused to comment on speculation that Mitsubishi could end up building cars for PSA and perhaps its Japanese rival Nissan.Mitsubishi has been hit by a recall scandal and the withdrawal of support from shareholder DaimlerChrysler"
BA to suspend two Saudi services,"""The decision to suspend flights between the UK and Saudi Arabia is a difficult one to make as we have enjoyed a long history of flying between the two countries,"" said BA director of commercial planning, Robert Boyle.British Airways is to halt its flights from London Heathrow to Jeddah and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia from 27 March.BA will now suspend the Saudi flights - which it says will remain ""under constant review"" - from 27 March.BA currently operates four flights per week from Heathrow to Jeddah, and three weekly journeys to Riyadh"
Cairn Energy in Indian gas find,"The firm, which last year made a number of other new finds in the Rajasthan area, said the latest discovery could lead to large gas volumes.Cairn has also been granted approval to extend its Rajasthan exploration area.A spokesman said the company's decision to carry out further investigations at the new find showed that it believed there was significant gas.Cairn's string of finds in Rajasthan last year saw it elevated to the FTSE 100 index of the UK's leading listed companies"
Asia quake increases poverty risk,"Nearly two million people across Asia could be thrown into poverty because of the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has said.The ADB fears that 1 million Indonesians could join them, while in India just over half a million people - 645,000 - are at risk of falling into poverty.Sri Lanka and the Maldives are the two countries the ADB fears are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami.But the economies of the affected countries except Sri Lanka and the Maldives should emerge with minimal damage,"" the ADB report said.A quarter of a million Sri Lankans and 23,500 people in the Maldives are also facing poverty.Thailand has said it does not wish to opt for a debt repayment freeze, while India has also rejected international aid, saying it can cope on its own resources.In its first overview of the disaster, the ADB said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major cities and factories escaped damage.""Poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster,"" said ADB chief economist Ifzal Ali.Sri Lanka's government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly $3bn.Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and India have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years, which should cushion them against reconstruction costs.The Paris Club of rich creditor nations on Wednesday offered to freeze debts owed by tsunami-hit countries"
Fosters buys stake in winemaker,"Australian brewer Fosters has bought a large stake in Australian winemaker Southcorp, sparking rumours of a possible takeover.Fosters bought 18.8% of Southcorp, the global winemaker behind the Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount brands, for 4.17 Australian dollars per share.Fosters bought the 18.8% stake from Reline Investments, the family investment firm for the Oatleys, who founded the Rosemount Estates label and sold it to Southcorp in 2001.Since then, it has paid $1bn for US wine maker Robert Mondavi, bought last month.Fosters has done a back-flip"", said Shawn Burns, a fund manger at Deutsche Asset Management.Fosters said it was currently in discussions ""which may lead to a major corporate announcement"".Analysts were divided on Thursday about whether Fosters was more likely to go for a takeover or merely wanted to take a big enough chunk of Southcorp to prevent it falling to a rival.The prospect of Fosters launching a major acquisition startled investors, as the brewer said last summer that it was not looking to expand through a big buy in the near future.Fosters' main wine business is Beringer Blass Wine Estate.Southcorp's shares have risen in recent months on speculation that it could become a takeover target"
ECB holds rates amid growth fears,"The ECB has forecast economic growth in the eurozone of 1.9% in 2005.Borrowing costs have remained on hold amid concerns about the strength of economic growth in the 12 nations sharing the euro, analysts said.ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has remained upbeat about prospects for the region, and inflation is expected to drop below 2% later in 2005.If anything, there may be greater calls for an interest rate cut, especially with the euro continuing to strengthen against the dollar.Inflation in the eurozone, however, is estimated at about 2.3% in December, above ECB guidelines of 2%.The ECB ""may sound rather hawkish but once the data allows them to cut again, they will."
China bans new tobacco factories,"""China won't allow any new tobacco factories to be built, including joint ventures"", said Xing Wangli, a spokesman for the State Tobacco Administration Monopoly quoted in China Daily.The world's biggest tobacco consumer, China, has said it will not allow any new tobacco factories to be built.In July 2004, Bat announced it had won approval for to build a $1.5bn (£800m) joint venture factory in China which would make it the first foreign cigarette maker to manufacture there.China already has more than enough cigarette-making capacity, according to a spokesman for the tobacco industry regulator quoted in China Daily.""Xing's statement comes as especially bad news for British American Tobacco"", the China Daily newspaper said of the latest development.The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration said a week later that it had not approved the deal, leading to an embarrassing public row.The Bat spokeswoman would not comment on its progress.China has 350 million smokers who consumer 1.7 trillion cigarettes a year.The Bat spokeswoman said: ""There is nothing for us to add...since our announcement in July last year.The decision to ban further tobacco factories does not apply to deals made before 2005, according to the French news agency AFP"
UK interest rates held at 4.75%,"CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had ""slowed in recent months in response to rate rises"" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer.Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future.""The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,"" he said.The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.""So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,"" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley.It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.Rates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August.Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium.""Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time."
German economy rebounds,"Germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said.""If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.""""During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,"" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt.The economy contracted in 2003.Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market"
US trade deficit widens sharply,"Although China's overall trade surplus is expanding, according to Chinese government figures, the Commerce Department revealed the US's deficit with China was $19.6bn in November, down from $19.7bn the month before.Against the pound, the dollar was down about 0.7% at $1,8923.But the deficit with Japan was at its worst in more than four years.The gap between US exports and imports has widened to more than $60bn (£31.7bn), an all-time record.One small bright spot for US policy-makers was a slight decline in the deficit with China, often blamed for job losses and other economic woes.By 1650 GMT, the dollar was trading against the euro at $1.3280, almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement.But the numbers suggested the sliding dollar - which makes exports less expensive - has had little impact, and could indicate slowing economic growth.The trade deficit is a large part of the latter"
Trade gap narrows as exports rise,"Overall UK exports - including both goods and services - rose by more than 3.2% to £24.8bn, although total imports rose again to a new record of £27.9bn.According to the Office for National Statistics, the difference between what the UK exported and imported was £3.1bn ($5.8bn), down from October's £3.6bn.The UK's deficit with the EU fell to £1.9bn from £2.1bn, while its non-EU shortfall dropped to £2.7bn from £2.9bn in October.During November the UK exported £16.9bn worth of goods, but imported £21.5bn.The deficit for goods alone was £4.6bn, down from October's £5bn.The cumulative deficit for the first eleven months of 2004 now stands at £36.3bn, £4.5bn higher than the same period in 2003.November saw an improvement in export levels to both the European Union and the rest of the world, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.EU exports rose 2%, fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals"
Lesotho textile workers lose jobs,"""We understand that some (owners)... were complaining that the South African rand was strong against the US dollar, and they were losing when exporting textiles and clothing to the United States,"" Mr Macaefa said at a news briefing in the capital, Maseru.In the mountainous country surrounded by South Africa, it is feared as many as 50,000 textile workers could lose their jobs, and Mr Mafeca said he expected more companies to leave.Six foreign-owned textile factories have closed in Lesotho, leaving 6,650 garment workers jobless, union officers told the AP news agency.The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), gave sub-Saharan countries preferential access to the US market for apparel and textile products as well as a wide range of other goods.Union leaders and trade campaigners have been warning that developing nations such as Lesotho, Sri Lanka, and Bangaldesh could lose thousands of jobs once the quotas were lifted.The assistance of a US law had given Lesotho's textiles duty-free access to North American markets"
Kraft cuts snack ads for children,"Kraft plans to cut back on advertising of products like Oreo cookies and sugary Kool-Aid drinks as part of an effort to promote healthy eating.It means commercials for some of its most famous snacks and cereals shown during early morning cartoon shows on TV will now be replaced by food and drink qualifying for Kraft's new ""Sensible Solution"" label.The largest US food maker will also add a label to its more nutritional and low-fat brands to promote the benefits.Kraft's new advertising policy, which covers advertising on TV, radio and in print publications, is aimed at children between the ages of six and 11"
Khodorkovsky quits Yukos shares,"Mr Khodorkovsky handed over his stake after the forced sale of Yukos' core oil production unit, Yuganskneftegaz to pay a giant tax bill.Mr Khodorkovsky handed over his entire 59.5% stake in holding company Group Menatep - which controls Yukos - to Leonid Nevzlin.It is also believed that Mr Khodorkovsky was particularly targeted because he had started to bankroll political opponents of Mr Putin.""Since the sale of Yuganskneftegaz, I have been delivered of (all) responsibility for the business that remains and the group's money as a whole,"" Mr Khodorkovsky said.Jailed tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky has transferred his controlling stake in oil giant Yukos to a business partner.Mr Nevzlin is Yukos' largest shareholder but is living in self-imposed exile in Israel"
Executive trio leave Aer Lingus,"Three senior executives of Ireland's state-owned airline, Aer Lingus, are set to leave early on 28 January after accusations of a conflict of interest.Last Friday the minister had announced he was to advertise for three senior executives for Aer Lingus.""What I do after I leave Aer Lingus is still too early to say,"" Mr Walsh told AP news agency on Wednesday.The three have refused to confirm reports they plan to launch a private airline in competition with Aer Lingus.Mr Walsh said there was no conflict of interest, and, if he was to launch a rival airline or join an existing competitor, ""this thing happens in every business"".Mr Walsh, who took charge in 2000, and his team have earned praise for turning Aer Lingus around, by cutting air fares and staff, and re-positioning it as a low-fare airline to rival Ryanair.On Wednesday Irish Transport Minister Martin Cullen said in a statement: ""A conflict of interest cannot, should not and will not be allowed to arise between their current roles at Aer Lingus and their future career intentions.""That decision had followed an announcement by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern - who is still considering the future of the airline - which ruled out a proposed management buy-out of Aer Lingus"
US in EU tariff chaos trade row,"""Although the EU is a customs union, there is no single EU customs administration,"" a statement issued on behalf of Robert Zoellick, US Trade Representative, said.The EU's own institutions have noted the uneven way EU customs rules are applied but failed to act, the US Trade Representative's Office said.The US said its trade with the 25 EU member countries was worth $155.2bn (£82.8bn) in 2003.The move came in the same week that the US and EU stepped back from confrontation in a tense dispute over aircraft subsidies to European manufacturer Airbus and US firm Boeing.Explaining why it has asked the WTO to set up a dispute settlement panel on customs barriers, the US Trade Representative's Office said that it wants to tackle the issue ""early in the EU's process of dealing with the problems of enlargement"".Lack of uniformity, coupled with lack of procedures for prompt EU-wide review can hinder US exports, especially for small to mid-sized businesses"", An EU spokesman in Washington dismissed the US complaint"
News Corp eyes video games market,"According to the Financial Times, chief operating officer Peter Chernin said that News Corp is ""kicking the tires of pretty much all video games companies"".Video games are ""big business"", the paper quoted Mr Chernin as saying.News Corp, the media company controlled by Australian billionaire Rupert Murdoch, is eyeing a move into the video games market.And with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies, video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun.The success of products such as Sony's Playstation, Microsoft's X-Box and Nintendo's Game Cube have boosted demand for video games"
US Ahold suppliers face charges,"US prosecutors have charged nine food suppliers with helping Dutch retailer Ahold inflate earnings by more than $800m (£428m).The nine now charged, who worked as suppliers to Ahold, are accused of signing false documents relating to the amount of money they paid the retailer for promoting their products in its stores.The suppliers in question are said to have inflated the amount of money they paid, providing auditors with signed letters that allowed Ahold to inflate its earnings.Ahold is the world's fourth-largest supermarket chain.Ahold hit the headlines in February 2003 after it emerged that there were accounting irregularities at its US subsidiary Foodservice.It was less severe than many had envisaged, however, and since then Ahold has worked hard at rebuilding its reputation and investor confidence.At the time of the scandal, Ahold was seen by many as Europe's Enron.Pasquale D'Amuro of the FBI called the nine vendors the key ingredients in ""the process of cooking the books"" at Ahold"
Wal-Mart fights back at accusers,"Meanwhile, drugs group Eli Lilly is planning a campaign against ""false"" claims about its product Prozac.Meanwhile Eli Lilly is launching a series of adverts in a dozen major newspapers, to present what is says are the true facts about its anti-depressant drug Prozac.Wal-Mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the Wall Street Journal, using an open letter from company president Lee Scott saying it was time for the public to hear the ""unfiltered truth"".Eli Lilly's chief medical officer Alan Breier said that the article was ""false and misleading"" as the documents it referred to were actually created by officials at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and presented to an FDA meeting in 1991.""I think they are going to have a tough time suddenly overcoming the perceptions of some people,"" said Larry Bevington, chairman of Save Our Community - a group fighting to prevent Wal-Mart opening a store in Rosemead, California.The world's biggest retailer Wal-Mart took out more than 100 full page adverts in national newspapers.Wal-Mart's average pay is almost twice the national minimum wage of $5.15 (£3.90) an hour, while employees are offered health and life insurance, company stock and a retirement plan, the adverts say.""It was simply wrong to suggest that information on Prozac was missing, or that important research data on the benefits and possible side effects of the drug were not available to doctors and regulators,"" the letter added"
US retail sales surge in December,"US retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in December, boosted by strong car sales.Sales for the year also broke through the $4 trillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4.06 trillion However, if automotives are excluded from December's data, retail sales rose just 0.3% on the month.Retail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the US.During that time, sales grew a lacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later.But as well as hitting the shops, more US consumers were going online or using mail order for their purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%.The increase in sales during December pushed total spending for the month to $349.4bn (£265.9bn).Dealers were forced to cut prices in December to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started.Sales climbed 8% for the year, the best performance since an 8.5% rise in 1999, the Commerce Department added"
Winemaker rejects Foster's offer,"Southcorp said Foster's takeover offer was ""opportunistic"".The two companies held four days of talks after Foster's bought an 18.8% stake in Southcorp on 13 January.Foster's said a combination of the two companies would create a global player with an ""unrivalled"" collection of premium wine brands.Southcorp said Foster's A$4.17-a-share takeover proposal offered a ""excellent strategic fit"" but undervalued the company.""Southcorp's board has informed Foster's that it is not prepared to recommend the offer as it does not adequately reflect the strategic value of the company,"" said Southcorp chairman Brian Finn.""The combination of Foster's and Southcorp will transform the global wine industry and significantly enhance Australia's competitive position on the global stage,"" said Trevor O'Hoy, Foster's chief executive officer"
McDonald's boss Bell dies aged 44,"Mr Bell took over as chief executive after his predecessor as CEO, Jim Cantalupo, died suddenly of a heart attack in April.Mr Bell leaves a wife and daughter.Having worked closely with Mr Cantalupo, who came out of retirement to turn McDonald's around, Mr Bell focused on boosting demand at existing restaurants rather than follow a policy of rapid expansion.Charlie Bell, the straight-talking former head of fast-food giant McDonald's, has died of cancer aged 44.Mr Bell oversaw McDonald's ""I'm lovin' it"" advertising campaign and introduced successes such as McCafe, now the biggest coffee shop brand in Australia and New Zealand.Joining the company as a 15-year-old part-time worker, Mr Bell quickly moved through its ranks, becoming Australia's youngest store manager at 19.Colleagues said that Mr Bell was proud of his humble beginnings, helping out behind cash tills and clearing tables when visiting restaurants"
US industrial output growth eases,"A breakdown of the latest production figures shows mining output drove the increase, surging 2.1%, while factory output rose 0.3%.The US Federal Reserve said output from factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3% - in line with forecasts - from a revised 0.6% increase in October.The US economy grew at a respectable annual rate of 3.7% in the three months between July and September, while jobs growth averaged 178,000 during the same period.Many analysts were upbeat about the prospects for the US economy, with the increase in production coming on the heels of news of a recovery in retail sales.US industrial production continued to rise in November, albeit at a slower pace than the previous month.The latest increase means industrial output has grown 4.2% in the past year"
LSE doubts boost bidders' shares,"In voicing its opposition to the planned takeover, TCI said it would prefer to see Deutsche Boerse return $500m (£350m) to shareholders.Deutsche Boerse said TCI's opposition would not change its bid approach.Another investor in Deutsche Boerse has supported the view that a payout to shareholders would be preferable to Deutsche Boerse overpaying for the LSE, Reuters news agency reported.The Deutsche Boerse was prepared to pay for the LSE ""exceeds the potential benefits of this acquisition"", said TCI.Shares in Deutsche Boerse have risen more than 3% after a shareholder fund voiced opposition to the firm's planned takeover of the London Stock Exchange.""Deutsche Boerse is convinced that its contemplated cash acquisition of the London Stock Exchange is in the best interests of its shareholders and the company,"" it said.TCI has called for Deutsche Boerse to hold an emergency general meeting to discuss the bid for LSE.Another Deutsche Boerse shareholder on Monday also appeared to back TCI's call.The Financial Times also reported a third Deutsche Boerse shareholder as opposed to the deal"
Qantas considers offshore option,"If Qantas were to follow the lead of other airlines moving staff 'offshore' 7,000 jobs could shift overseas, the newspaper reported.In a statement, Qantas said it was looking to build its operations overseas.Unions criticised the possible move - which may affect cabin and maintenance staff - saying Qantas was profitable.Qantas confirmed it was looking at whether it might recruit and source products overseas - potentially through joint ventures - but said it would continue to create jobs in Australia.Australian airline Qantas could transfer as many as 7,000 jobs out of its home country as it seeks to save costs, according to newspaper reports.Unions reacted angrily to the reported disclosure, arguing that Qantas was profitable and did not need to take such action.""We're going to have to get the lowest cost structure we can and that willmean sourcing things more and more from overseas,"" the newspaper quoted Qantas chief executive Geoff Dixon as saying"
Gazprom 'in $36m back-tax claim',"Gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm Rosneft, the company that eventually acquired Yuganskneftegas, the main unit of embattled oil giant Yukos.Gazprom is one of the key players in the complex Russian energy market, where the government of Vladimir Putin has made moves to regain state influence over the sector.The nuclear unit of Russian energy giant Gazprom is reportedly facing a 1bn rouble ($35.7m; £19.1m) back-tax claim for the 2001-2003 period.Gazprom, the biggest gas company in the world, took over nuclear fuel giant Atomstroieksport in October 2004"
Germany calls for EU reform,"Mr Schroeder also called for heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact.Mr Schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current 3% limit if they met certain criteria.Mr Schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions.Mr Schroeder's intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 Eurozone finance ministers on Monday to discuss the pact.Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms.Deficits should be allowed to rise above 3%, Mr Schroeder argued, if countries meet several ""mandatory criteria"".German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has called for radical reform of the EU's stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits"
Parmalat founder offers apology,"The founder and former boss of Parmalat has apologised to investors who lost money as a result of the Italian dairy firm's collapse.Mr Tanzi spent several months in jail in the wake of Parmalat's collapse and was kept under house arrest until last September.He has alleged that these companies were aware of the true state of Parmalat's finances but continued to lend money to the company.Two former Parmalat auditors will stand trial later this month for their role in the firm's collapse.More than 130,000 people lost money following the firm's collapse.Parmalat is now being run by a state appointed administrator, Enrico Bondi, who has launched lawsuits against 80 banks in an effort to recover money for the bankrupt company and its shareholders"
'Golden economic period' to end,"""Whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.""This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year, when the economy expanded by 3.25%.Ten years of ""golden"" economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly, City consultancy Deloitte has warned.Deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, below Chancellor Gordon Brown's forecast of 3% to 3.5%.In its quarterly economic review, Deloitte said the UK economy had enjoyed a ""golden period"" during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s.Economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, Deloitte believes"
Jobs go at Oracle after takeover,"""By retaining the vast majority of Peoplesoft technical staff, Oracle will have the resources to deliver on the development and support commitments we have made to Peoplesoft customers over the last 18 months,"" Oracle's chief executive Larry Ellison said in a statement.The company said it would retain more than 90% of Peoplesoft product development and product support staff.Oracle has announced it is cutting about 5,000 jobs following the completion of its $10.3bn takeover of its smaller rival Peoplesoft last week.A Peoplesoft sign had been turned into shrine to the company, with flowers, candles and company memorabilia.In a statement, Oracle said it began notifying staff of redundancies on Friday and the process would continue over the next 10 days.""We're mourning the passing of a great company,"" the agency quoted Peoplesoft worker David Ogden as saying.They say Mr Ellison may be trying to placate Peoplesoft customers riled by Oracle's determined takeover strategy.""Peoplesoft had an easygoing, relaxed atmosphere"
Beijingers fume over parking fees,"Mr Wang, who is in charge of collecting car parking fees, said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap.Choking traffic jams in Beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges.The trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, making motorists reluctant to use them.Indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones.Indoor parking may be costly, but it is not always secure.""The price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable,"" said Wang Yan, an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development and Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper"
GM issues 2005 profits warning,"GMAC has been a strong contributor to profits in 2004 but GM said it will do less well this year, delivering net income of $2.5bn.GM said it expects to meet its 2004 earnings targets ""despite a tough competitive environment"".GM said higher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005.GM said it was expecting ""reduced financial losses"" in Europe in 2005.It said it would deliver a shareholder payout of $6.0-$6.5 per share this year, as promised, but that next year's earnings per share would be lower, at between $4.0-$5.0.The car maker has diversified into financial services, and is extending the reach of General Motors Acceptance Corp (GMAC), which has said it may enter the home loans market"

Wall Street cool to eBay's profit,"EBay now forecasts 2005 revenue of $4.2bn to $4.35bn and earnings excluding items of $1.48 to $1.52 per share.Analysts had previously estimated that eBay would achieve 2005 revenues of $4.37bn and earnings of $1.62 per share, excluding items.For 2004 as a whole, eBay earned $778.2m on sales of $3.27bn.Excluding special items, eBay's profit was 33 cents a share, but analysts had expected 34 cents.""I think Wall Street has gotten a bit ahead of eBay this quarter and for the 2005 year."
WorldCom trial starts in New York,"The trial of Bernie Ebbers, former chief executive of bankrupt US phone company WorldCom, has started in New York with the selection of the jury.Mr Ebbers, 63, is accused of being the mastermind behind an $11bn (£6bn) accounting fraud that eventually saw the firm collapse in July 2002.Under Mr Ebbers' leadership, WorldCom emerged from Mississippi obscurity to become a $160bn telecoms giant and the darling of late 1990s investors.Mr Ebbers' trial, which is expected to last two months, is the latest in a series of attempts by US prosecutors to pursue senior executives for fraud.If found guilty, Mr Ebbers could face a substantial jail sentence"
High fuel costs hit US airlines,"""AMR's results for the fourth quarter of 2004 reflect the economic woes that plagued the airline industry throughout 2004 - in particular, high fuel prices and a tough revenue environment,"" he said.American, the world's biggest airline by some measures, said it expected to report a loss for the first quarter of 2005.American Airlines' parent AMR reported a loss of $387m (£206m) for the fourth quarter of 2004, against a $111m loss for the same period a year earlier.Southwest, which has the highest market value of any US carrier, said it would remain profitable despite high fuel prices.Two of the largest airlines in the US - American and Southwest - have blamed record fuel prices for their disappointing quarterly results.Both American and Southwest have been squeezed by cut-throat competition in the US airline industry, as a glut of available seats has led to fierce price reductions"
European losses hit GM's profits,"For the whole of 2004, GM earned $3.7bn, down from $3.8bn in 2003, while its annual revenue rose 4.5% to $193bn.GM's revenues rose 4.7% to $51.2bn from $48.8bn a year earlier.General Motors (GM) saw its net profits fall 37% in the last quarter of 2004, as it continued to be hit by losses at its European operations.The US giant earned $630m (£481.5m) in the October-to-December period, down from $1bn in the fourth quarter of 2003.GM said its profits were also hit by higher healthcare costs in the US"
EU to probe Alitalia 'state aid',"The European Commission has officially launched an in-depth investigation into whether Italian airline Alitalia is receiving illegal state aid.Both the Italian government and Alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid.Alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997.While Alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability, the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition.""We now have to verify certain aspects to confirm that this plan contains no state aid.Otherwise, EU regulations on state aid stipulate that governments may help companies financially, but only on the same terms as a commercial investor.The matter of possible state aid was brought to the Commission's attention by eight of Alitalia's rivals, including Germany's Lufthansa, British Airways and Spain's Iberia"
IMF agrees fresh Turkey funding,"However, Turkey has a huge debt burden - already owing $23bn to the IMF - while its current account deficit has swelled to $10.7bn this year.Turkey's current $18.6bn loan agreement with the IMF expires in February and the new deal would see it receive added support between 2005 and 2007.The agreement would also enable Turkey to defer payments on previous loans worth $3.7m until 2006.Turkey has agreed a draft proposal with the International Monetary Fund to borrow $10bn (£5.19bn), extending its ongoing financial support until 2007.As part of the draft agreement, Turkey has signed a ""letter of intent"" stating its determination to push through far-reaching reforms to its tax and benefits system and its banking sector.In return for the funding, Turkey would be expected to keep inflation under control and introduce market reforms"
Saudi investor picks up the Savoy,"He also has substantial stakes in Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, which will manage the Savoy and Simpson's in the Strand, and Four Seasons.Fairmont said it planned to invest $48m (£26m) in renovating parts of the Savoy including the River Room and suites with views over the River Thames.London's famous Savoy hotel has been sold to a group combining Saudi billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and a unit of HBOS bank"
Tsunami slows Sri Lanka's growth,"Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from Sri Lanka's economic growth this year.The IMF said that the Sri Lankan authorities' initial estimates have put the physical damage at $1.3 to $1.5bn, but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this.President Kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict.Sri Lanka's president has launched a reconstruction drive worth $3.5bn (£1.8bn) by appealing for peace and national unity.Separately, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in Sri Lanka and Indonesia alone.The ILO estimated that 400,000 Sri Lankans have lost their jobs, mostly in these three industries.Reconstruction efforts in eastern Sri Lanka have been hampered by tensions between the two sides.Last week, the IMF approved Sri Lanka's request for a freeze on loan repayments.Growth, inflation, the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs.Earnings from tourism this year are expected to be 15% lower than last year"
China suspends 26 power projects,"The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity.China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.""Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,"" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website.The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year.Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River.The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China.The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments.Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted.The Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad"

Watchdog probes Vivendi bond sale,"Vivendi has rejected the charge, saying the decision to buy the Cegetel shares was ""no more than a possibility, of which the public was perfectly aware"" at the time of the bond issue.Vivendi, however, has said that the information was public knowledge as Mr Davis' offer for the US assets had already been rejected by Vivendi's board.French stock market regulator AMF has filed complaints against media giant Vivendi Universal, its boss and another top executive.AMF is also looking into whether the executives knew that Vivendi was considering exercising its right to buy British Telecom's shares in Cegetel.It believes the prospectus for a bond issue was unclear and that executives may have had privileged information.Vivendi advisor Deutsche Bank was also the subject of a complaint filing"
Saudi NCCI's shares soar,"Shares in Saudi Arabia's National Company for Cooperative Insurance (NCCI) soared on their first day of trading in Riyadh.Previously, only NCCI has been legally allowed to offer insurance products within Saudi Arabia.The listing was part of the country's plans to open up its insurance market and boost demand in the sector.Saudi Arabia now wants a fully functioning insurance industry and is introducing legislation that will clamp down on unauthorised companies.Saudi Arabia sold 7 million NCCI shares, or about 70% of the company's total capital last month"
JP Morgan admits US slavery links,"Thousands of slaves were accepted as collateral for loans by two banks that later became part of JP Morgan Chase.Citizens Bank and Canal Bank are the two lenders that were identified.The bank said that it is a ""very different company than the Citizens and Canal Banks of the 1800s"".""We apologise to the African-American community, particularly those who are descendants of slaves, and to the rest of the American public for the role that Citizens Bank and Canal Bank played.""The admission is part of an apology sent to JP Morgan staff after the bank researched its links to slavery in order to meet legislation in Chicago"
Egypt and Israel seal trade deal,"In a sign of a thaw in relations between Egypt and Israel, the two countries have signed a trade protocol with the US, allowing Egyptian goods made in partnership with Israeli firms free access to American markets.The US describes this as the most important economic agreement between Egypt and Israel in two decades.There has been deep sensitivity in Egypt about any form of co-operation with Israel as long as its peace process with the Palestinians remains blocked.Both exchanged prisoners earlier this month, with Egypt handing back an Israeli who has served eight years in prison after being convicted for spying.The protocol establishing the zones has been stalled for years.Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has described Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as the best chance for the Palestinians to achieve peace"

Christmas sales worst since 1981,"""The retail sales figures are very weak, but as Bank of England governor Mervyn King indicated last night, you don't really get an accurate impression of Christmas trading until about Easter,"" said Mr Shaw.The last time retailers endured a tougher Christmas was 23 years previously, when sales plunged 1.7%.A number of retailers have already reported poor figures for December.Retail sales dropped by 1% on the month in December, after a 0.6% rise in November, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.Clothing retailers and non-specialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth, according to the ONS.UK retail sales fell in December, failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst Christmas since 1981.Yet, other retailers - including HMV, Monsoon, Jessops, Body Shop and Tesco - reported that festive sales were well up on last year"
Businesses fail to plan for HIV,"Nearly 9,000 business leaders in 104 countries were surveyed for Business and HIV/AIDS: Commitment and Action?Across sub-Saharan Africa, even in countries with an HIV prevalence of 10-19%, only around 7% of companies have formal HIV/Aids policies in place, according to the report.The WEF report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to HIV/Aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them.The WEF report shows that despite the fact that 14,000 people contract HIV/Aids every day, concern among businesses has dropped by 23% in the last 12 months.""Effective action on HIV/Aids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations,"" said Brian Brink, senior vice-president, health, at Anglo-American.Nor could over 65% of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of HIV among their staff.The report adds ""an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the HIV/Aids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting,"" said David Bloom, professor of economics and demography at the Harvard School of Public Health.""Too few companies are responding proactively to the social and business threats,"" said Dr Kate Taylor, head of the WEF's global Health Initiative.Dr Taylor described the level of action taken by businesses as revealed by the report as ""too little, too late"""

UK young top Euro earnings league,"Children in the UK between the ages of 10 and 17 had an annual income of £775, said market analyst Datamonitor.They use ""pester power"" to get their parents to stump up nearly a third of this income, the report said.According to the Datamonitor report the trend marked British teenagers out as ""particularly important to cosmetics manufacturers as they are likely to experiment more with brands and products and form long-term beauty routines"".British children enjoy the highest average annual income in Europe - more than double that of Spanish or Italian youngsters, a report suggests"
Swiss cement firm in buying spree,"The deal with Aggregates will give Holcim, the world's second-biggest cement maker, an entry into the UK market and boost its presence in the US.Swiss cement firm Holcim has bid $800m (£429m) to buy two Indian cement firms and a holding company in the country.It plans to buy Associated Cement Companies (ACC), Ambuja Cement Eastern and the holding firm, Ambuja Cement India Ltd, a Holcim statement said.ACC is India's second-largest cement maker with an annual capacity of 18.2 million tonnes and a market share of 13%.If the Indian deals go ahead, it will give Holcim a major presence in the world's fastest-growing market behind China.Meanwhile, UK-based firm Aggregate Industries said it had agreed a £1.8bn takeover by Holcim"
India's Reliance family feud heats up,"However, Anil's demand that Anand Jain - another IPCL board member accused by Anil of creating a rift in the Ambani family - be thrown out, was not met.On Wednesday, the board of Reliance Energy, another Reliance Group company, reaffirmed its faith in Anil, who is the company's chief.The move follows a decision earlier this month by Anil - the younger brother of Reliance Group president Mukesh Ambani - to resign from his post.The ongoing public spat between the two heirs of India's biggest conglomerate, Reliance Group, has spilled over to the board meeting of a leading company within the group.Anil has accused Anand Jain, a confidant of his brother Mukesh, of playing a negative role in the Ambani family, and being responsible for the trouble between the brothers.Reliance Group acquired the government's 26% stake in IPCL - India's second-largest petrochemicals company - in 2002, as part of the privatisation drive"
World leaders gather to face uncertainty,"More than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the Swiss mountain resort Davos for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF).But much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to Davos, not least because the agenda of this year's forum seems to lack an overarching theme.The Brazilian city of Porto Alegre will host the rival World Social Forum, timed to run in parallel with the WEF's ritzier event in Davos.Mr Gates' company, software giant Microsoft, also hopes to use Davos to shore up its defences against open source software like Linux, which threaten Microsoft's near monopoly on computer desktops.However, many of the issues discussed in Porto Alegre are Davos talking points as well.UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and South African President Thabo Mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting.Davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between Yassir Arafat and Mr Peres came close to a peace deal.Microsoft founder Bill Gates, the world's richest man and a regular at Davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either.The US government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise appearance in Davos.Davos itself is in deep frost.Mr Gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with Brazil's President Lula da Silva.Having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against Aids and Malaria, Mr Gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases.At Davos, global problem solving and networking are never far apart"
US budget deficit to reach $368bn,"The budget deficit hit a record $412bn in the 12 months to 30 September 2004, after reaching $377bn in the previous fiscal year.The US budget deficit is set to hit a worse-than-expected $368bn (£197bn) this year, officials said on Tuesday.Past Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts said there would be a $348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year.The cost of military operations still needs to be factored in, with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further $100bn in the red.The CBO also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015, an improvement on previous projections.In November, the gap between US exports and imports widened to more than $60bn, a record figure"
Criminal probe on Citigroup deals,"""I can confirm that BaFin has passed through the case to the public prosecutor,"" a BaFin spokeswoman said.""We are disappointed that the BaFin has referred to the prosecutor the question of whether action should be brought against individuals involved,"" Citigroup said.Traders at US banking giant Citigroup are facing a criminal investigation in Germany over a controversial bond deal.Germany's financial watchdog BaFin told BBC News it had now transferred the investigation to the public prosecutor.However, under German criminal law, prosecutors cannot pursue Citigroup itself.The move was widely criticised at the time, and now the German regulator has said it has found evidence of possible market manipulation"
Brazil jobless rate hits new low,"Brazil's unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in three years in December, according to the government.IBGE also said that average monthly salaries grew 1.9% in December 2004 from December 2003.The Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE) said it fell to 9.6% in December from 10.6% in November and 10.9% in December 2003.The jobless rate average for the whole of 2004 was 11.5%, down from 12.3% in 2003, the IBGE said.The unemployment rate has been falling gradually since April 2004 when it reached a peak of 13.1%.However, average monthly wages fell 1.8% in December to 895.4 reais ($332; £179.3) from November"
Indonesia 'declines debt freeze',"Indonesia, which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer, owes the Paris Club about $48bn (£25.5bn).Mr Bakrie told the Bisnis Indonesia newspaper that a $1.7bn donors' aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary.Indonesia no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the Paris Club group of creditors, Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie has reportedly said.Nevertheless, one of Mr Bakrie's deputies, Mahendra Siregar, told AFP news agency that Indonesia was still considering the offer by the Paris Club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments.Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Seychelles accepted the Paris Club offer, which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little.The 19 member countries of the Paris Club are owed about $5bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami"
Parmalat bank barred from suing,"But a judge has barred Bank of America and two auditors from the case.The bank, and Italaudit - formerly the Italian arm of auditor Grant Thornton - face lawsuits and possible prosecution.A second auditor, Deloitte & Touche, has also been banned from the case"
China continues rapid growth,"And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004.Despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said.Growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year.China's economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003's 9.1%.China raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in October 2004.China's economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas.But officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus.Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate"
SEC to rethink post-Enron rules,"The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.The US stock market watchdog's chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (£374m).Mr Donaldson said the SEC would ""consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process"" for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements.The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing.European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly.Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings.Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would ""continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements"""
BBC poll indicates economic gloom,"In percentage terms, an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse, compared to 34% who said it was improving.The poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill, compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving.The Philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents' families, but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy.Most respondents also said their national economy was getting worse.Almost 23,000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll, which was mostly conducted before the Asian tsunami disaster.The countries where people were most optimistic, both for the world and for their own families, were two fast-growing developing economies, China and India, followed by Indonesia.Citizens in a majority of nations surveyed in a BBC World Service poll believe the world economy is worsening.Pipa conducted the poll from 15 November 2004 to 3 January 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews.""While the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago, people seem to not have fully absorbed this development, though they are personally experiencing its effects,"" said Pipa director Steven Kull.But when asked about their own family's financial outlook, a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future"
Europe asks Asia for euro help,"European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro.The European single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months.China is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar.But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden"

Millions go missing at China bank,"The other is China Construction Bank.The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings.Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder.Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas.Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke.Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.The pair both worked at Bank of China in the northern city of Harbin, the South China Morning Post reported.The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003.Two senior officials at one of China's top commercial banks have reportedly disappeared after funds worth up to $120m (£64m) went missing.China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness"

Water firm Suez in Argentina row,"The government has rejected the 60% rise and wants Aguas Argentinas to make an annual investment of 400m pesos ($136m; £72.3m) in improvements.But last week, Argentine Economic Minister, Roberto Lavagna, told the French media in Paris that the government was considering allowing a 16% increase in tariffs and the possibility of a State contribution to Aguas Argentinas infrastructure investments.He added that the government is in discussions with Aguas Argentinas about what role it might take in the event that a State contribution is agreed.A conflict between the Argentine State and water firm Aguas Argentinas, controlled by France's Suez, is casting doubt on the firm's future.The Planning Minister didn't rule out the possibility of cancelling Aguas Argentinas water concession.In Argentina, Suez's subsidiary, which has been fined for cutting the supply of water during a recent heat wave and allegedly failing to keep up investment to meet the demand for water, has maintained a tense relationship with the Argentine government.On May 2004, Aguas Argentinas and the government signed an agreement to renegotiate its Buenos Aires water-concession contract.He added that in the coming weeks the future of Aguas Argentinas would be decided.Suez owns 40% of Aguas Argentinas (39.9%), while Spain's Aguas de Barcelona is its second biggest shareholder with 25.01%.However, Aguas Argentinas told the Argentine newspaper Clarin it would not accept any change to its legal structure and, in practice, this rules out State participation on its board.He has also asked for more investments to meet the growing demand for water"

Aids and climate top Davos agenda,"At the same time, about 100,000 people are expected to converge on the Brazilian resort of Porto Alegre for the World Social Forum - the so-called ""anti-Davos"" for campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes.A survey published on the eve of the conference by PricewaterhouseCoopers said four in ten business leaders were ""very confident"" that their companies would see sales rise in 2005.Aside from Mr Blair, more than 20 other world leaders are expected to attend including French President Jacques Chirac - due to speak by video link after bad weather delayed his helicopter - and South African President Thabo Mbeki, whose arrival has been delayed by Ivory Coast peace talks.The World Health Organisation (WHO) said 700,000 people in poor countries were on life-extending drugs - up from 440,000 six months earlier but amounting to only 12% of the 5.8 million who needed them.Showbiz figures will also put in an appearance, from U2 frontman Bono - a well-known campaigner on trade and development issues - to Angelina Jolie, a goodwill campaigner for the UN on refugees.In contrast, the Davos forum is dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world's 500 largest companies scheduled to attend.Climate change and the fight against Aids are leading the list of concerns for the first day of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos.Some 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe will listen to UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's opening speech on Wednesday"

UK economy ends year with spurt,"Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Gerrard, said: ""This outturn (of 0.7%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the UK economy.""The ONS said the services sector, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the UK economy, grew 1.0% in the quarter.The ONS said a sharp fall in mining and quarrying, which was driven by oil and gas extraction, was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures.And he said the GDP figures may help to ""push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve"".The UK economy grew by an estimated 3.1% in 2004 after accelerating in the last quarter of the year, says the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The annual figure marked out the best year since 2000, and was also well ahead of the 2.2% recorded in 2003.""The fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend (growth) and I am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown,"" said Ross Walker, UK economist at RBS Financial Markets.But Steve Radley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation EEF, said: ""These figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground"
