"Dibaba breaks 5,000m world record","Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba set a new world record in winning the women's 5,000m at the Boston Indoor Games.The plan was to go with 500m to go no matter what, but when Bekele made the mistake that was it.Dibaba won in 14 minutes 32.93 seconds to erase the previous world indoor mark of 14:39.29 set by another Ethiopian, Berhane Adera, in Stuttgart last year.Ireland's Alistair Cragg won in 7:39.89 as Bekele battled to second in 7:41.42"

Verdict delay for Greek sprinters,"Greek athletics' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou for missing doping tests.The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry.""I am confident and optimistic,"" Thanou had said at the time.The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests.The pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year's Athens Olympics"
Call for Kenteris to be cleared,"Kostas Kenteris' lawyer has called for the doping charges against the Greek sprinter to be dropped.Kenteris and compatriot Katerina Thanou were given provisional suspensions in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics.Kenteris and Thanou withdrew from the Athens Olympics last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony.The lawyer added that he has proof the authorities ""knew"" Kenteris was in Germany at the time he was alleged to have missed a test in Chicago.Gregory Ioannidis has submitted new evidence to a Greek athletics tribunal which he claims proves the former Olympic champion has no case to answer"
Merritt close to indoor 400m mark,"Kenyan Bernard Lagat missed out on the world record by 1.45secs as he ran the third quickest indoor mile ever to beat Canada's Nate Brannen by almost 10secs.The Olympic silver medallist's time of three minutes 49.89secs was inferior only to the 1997 world record of Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj and former world record holder Eamonn Coghlan of Ireland's 3:49.78.World indoor 60m hurdles champion  also won, improving his season-leading time to 7.51secs.Only Michael Johnson has gone quicker, setting the world record of 44.63secs in 1995 and running 44.66secs in 1996.Olympic 200m gold medallist  of Jamaica ran the fastest women's 60m in the world this year as she equalled her personal best of 7.09secs"

Edwards tips Idowu for Euro gold,"World outdoor triple jump record holder and BBC pundit Jonathan Edwards believes Phillips Idowu can take gold at the European Indoor Championships.Idowu landed 17.30m at the British trials in Sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings.""It's all down to him, but if he jumps as well as he did in Sheffield he could win the gold medal,"" said Edwards.Edwards himself kept Idowu off top spot at the Manchester Games.The qualifying round of the men's triple jump in Madrid takes place on Friday with the final scheduled for Saturday"
Chepkemei hit by big ban,"Athletics Kenya (AK) issued the ban after Chepkemei failed to turn up for a cross country training camp in Embu.Global Sports Communications, Chepkemei's management company, said she had wanted to run in the World Cross Country Championships in March.KA has also threatened three-time women's short-course champion Edith Masai with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true.But the ban will prevent the two-time world half-marathon silver medallist from challenging Radcliffe at this year's London event in April.Kenya's athletics body has suspended two-time London Marathon runner-up Susan Chepkemei from all competition until the end of the year.""We have banned her from all local and international competitions,"" said AK chief Isaiah Kiplagat"
Holmes secures comeback victory,"I was nervous about whether I would actually be able to get round.""It was all about winning in front of my home crowd.Holmes hit the front just before the bell in front of a sell-out crowd in Glasgow and cruised to victory in a time of four minutes 14.74 seconds.""It was nice to get that out of the way.The Olympic 800m and 1500m champion's time was inside the qualifying mark for the European Indoor Championships in Madrid in March.Britain's Kelly Holmes marked her first appearance on home soil since winning double Olympic gold with 1500m victory at the Norwich Union International"
Greek pair attend drugs hearing,"Yiannis Papadoyiannakis, who was head of the Greek Olympic team at the Athens Games last year, also testified at the tribunal, along with other Greek sports officials and athletes.The five-member tribunal, assembled by the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics, is also examining allegations that Kenteris and Thanou avoided tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago before the Games.They were given provisional suspensions by athletics' ruling body the IAAF in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics.Tzekos was also banned for two years by the IAAF.Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have appeared before an independent tribunal which will decide if their bans should stand.All three, who have repeatedly denied the allegations, have also been charged by a Greek prosecutor and face trial for doping-related charges.""There is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.""But Kenteris' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis told BBC Sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing.""I believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution,"" said Papadoyiannakis"
Chepkemei joins Edinburgh line-up,"Susan Chepkemei has decided she is fit enough to run in next month's Great Edinburgh International Cross Country.Recently-crowned European cross country champion Briton Hayley Yelling also competes in Edinburgh on 15 January, as does in-form Scot Kathy Butler.Chepkemei, who won the six kilometre event three years ago when it was staged in Newcastle, endured an epic battle with Radcliffe in the Big Apple until the Briton outsprinted her in the final 400m"
El Guerrouj targets cross country,"Double Olympic champion Hicham El Guerrouj is set to make a rare appearance at the World Cross Country Championships in France.""I haven't quite decided what events I will compete in prior to London but the World Cross Country is an event which is also special to me and is a definite possibility,"" said the two-time champion.El Guerrouj could meet Bekele in March as the Ethiopian is the defending world cross country champion over both the long and short courses.- Britain's Paula Radcliffe has also not ruled out competing in the World Cross Country Championships.But the Moroccan, who has not raced over cross country for 15 years, will not decide until two weeks before the event which starts on 19 March.And he is aiming to break 10,000m Olympic champion Kenenisa Bekele's 5,000m and 10,000m world records"
Collins appeals against drugs ban,Sprinter Michelle Collins has lodged an appeal against her eight-year doping ban with the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).The San Francisco-based Balco laboratory is at the centre of the scandal which has rocked the sport.Collins was suspended by the US Anti-Doping Agency based on patterns observed in her blood and urine tests as well as evidence in the Balco investigation.The 33-year-old received the ban last month as a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal
Holmes feted with further honour,"Double Olympic champion Kelly Holmes has been voted European Athletics (EAA) woman athlete of 2004 in the governing body's annual poll.Her gutsy victory in the 800m also earned her the International Association of Athletics Federations' award for the best women's performance in the world for 2004.And she scooped two awards at the British Athletics Writers' Association annual dinner in October.The Briton, made a dame in the New Year Honours List for taking 800m and 1,500m gold, won vital votes from the public, press and EAA member federations"
Campbell to extend sprint career,"""To go to Athens and finally get the gold I've been trying to get for 24 years was a big relief,"" said Campbell.Campbell, who won Olympic 4x100m relay gold, had been unsure about his future.Campbell was part of the British quartet who shocked the Americans to win relay gold in Athens in August.The 31-year-old, who won Olympic 200m silver in Sydney in 2000, said during the Games that a hamstring injury had stopped him from running at his best.""I've started back and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.He was criticised at the time by former Olympic champion Michael Johnson, who cast doubt on Campbell's injury claims.Campbell set his 100m personal best of 10.04secs when he won the European title in Budapest in 1998"
Isinbayeva heads for Birmingham,"Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva has confirmed she will take part in the 2005 Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham on 18 February.Isinbayeva, 22, has set 10 world records in the pole vault, three of which have come on British soil.The pair had a thrilling battle in Athens which ended with Isinbayeva finally jumping a world record of 4.91m to claim the gold medal.I always seem to break records there,"" said Isinbayeva"
2004: An Irish Athletics Year,"At the start of the year, several Northern Ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the Games but come August, an out-of-form and injured Paul Brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province.Sonia O'Sullivan's Olympic farewell apart, there was little to stir the emotions of Irish athletics watchers.Once the track and field action began in Athens, a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although Alistair Cragg's performance in being the only athlete from a European nation to qualify for the 5,000m final did offer hope for the future.But come late August, a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in Athens told us of the true strength of Irish athletics - or to be more accurate, the lack of it.At least Sonia managed to make it to Athens.Amazingly, she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the Flora Lite 5K road race in London and while her major championship days may be over, it's unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition.As it happened, she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner Meseret Defar.800m hope McIlroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the British trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane.The injury-plagued Turnbull gamely travelled round Europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best he could achieve, after missing several months training during the previous winter.2004 won't be remembered as one of Irish athletics' great years.Less than a week before the Olympics, the sport was rocked by news that 10,000m hope Cathal Lombard had tested for the banned substance EPO.James McIlroy, Gareth Turnbull, Zoe Brown and Paul McKee all had to be content with watching the Athens action on their television screens"
Sprinter Walker quits athletics,"""I had intended to race but I'm running like a goon,"" said Walker.Walker had hoped to compete in the New Year Sprint which is staged at Musselburgh Racecourse near Edinburgh on Tuesday and Wednesday.He told the Herald newspaper: ""I'm not in great shape, after missing about a month of training.Former European 200m champion Dougie Walker is to retire from athletics after a series of six operations left him struggling for fitness"
Bekele sets sights on world mark,"Olympic 10,000m champion Kenenisa Bekele is determined to add the world indoor two mile record at February's Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham.And Bekele is no stranger to overhauling world marks at the National Indoor Arena.The Ethiopian broke the world indoor 5,000m record on his debut at the meeting last year.""And aiming for the two mile world record in Birmingham is the next of those targets.""Compatriots Mulugeta Wondimu, Abiyote Abate and Markos Geneti, the world indoor bronze medallist over 3000m, will race against Bekele on 18 February"
Greek sprinters suspended by IAAF,"""There will be a final right of appeal from the decision of the Greek Federation to the Court of Arbitration for Sport,"" the IAAF said.Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have been suspended after failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics.Wednesday's statement said the Greek Federation (SEGAS) would convene a disciplinary hearing for the trio to determine whether there had been doping violations.Kenteris, the 2000 Olympic 200m champion, and Thanou, the women's 100m silver medallist from the same Games in Sydney, also face a criminal hearing in Greece over the missed tests.They face two-year bans if found guilty by the Greek Athletics Federation.Athletics' ruling body the IAAF said explanations from the pair and their former coach as to why they missed the tests were ""unacceptable"""
Athens memories soar above lows,"And it was a bit of a rarity for me too because I genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out.Dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise.It was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her Athens story.One of my favourite Olympic moments was Kelly's success in the 800m.Winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality.So to have an Australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special.The victory for the British men's 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the Games.That was her heart and not her head reacting.He was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles.And one of the positive things to come out of Balco is people are starting to blow the whistle.It was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, Paula showed real ""bouncebackability"".The thing is if we don't have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn't look good for the Beijing Olympics and beyond.What happened to Paula in Athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well.The only individual men's finalist on the track was Michael East in the 1500m.Dani Barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for Team GB.Paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.The lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake.Well, it's goodbye to another Olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in Athens.And that's where things begin to look even gloomier for British athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in Italy"
Collins banned in landmark case,"Sprinter Michelle Collins has received an eight-year ban for doping offences after a hearing at the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).""The USADA has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Collins took EPO, the testosterone/epitestosterone cream and THG,"" said a CAS statement.Collins' ban is a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal.USADA chief executive officer Terry Madden said the action taken against Collins was further proof of that.The USADA has built its cases on verbal evidence given to the federal investigation into Balco rather than test results.So far a total of 13 athletes have been sanctioned for violations involving drugs associated with the Balco doping scandal.The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) decided to press charges against Collins in the summer"
Jones doping probe begins,"Jones, who says she is innocent, could lose all her Olympic medals after Conte said he gave her performance-enhancing drugs before the Sydney Olympics.The Sydney Olympics ended more than four years ago, but World Anti-Doping Agency chief Dick Pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now.An investigation into doping claims against Marion Jones has been opened by the International Olympic Committee.""Victor Conte's allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward,"" she said"
Johnson accuses British sprinters,"Their focus has to be on being the best in the world and not just on being the top British sprinter.""Former Olympic champion Michael Johnson has accused Britain's top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition.""At the moment, the biggest factor on the mind of British sprinters is to be number one in Britain,"" the world 200m and 400m record holder told Five Live.""The only time you see British sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is a debate as to which one is better than the other,"" he claimed.And the American remains highly critical of aspects of British sprinting.Speaking at an elite coaches' conference in Birmingham, Johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in Britain, it had not necessarily reaped the rewards"
Radcliffe proves doubters wrong,"And a lot of people were wondering what would happen if Paula was forced to drop out of this race, as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in Athens.And if she lost, people would say her career was over.I was speaking to Paula in the lead-up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no-win situation.If Paula's last experience of the year had been Athens, it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism.It was a strong field, with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning.Now Paula will take part in the Run London 10km race in London at the end of the year, have a well-earned rest over Christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism.Even if she'd lost this race, there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it.But that was never on the cards.She thought that if she won, people would say ""why couldn't she do that in Athens?"
Jones medals 'must go if guilty',"""If she is found guilty she should be stripped of all her medals and banned for two years,"" said Pound.World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chief Dick Pound says Marion Jones should be stripped of all her medals if found guilty of taking banned substances.Asked if there was a timescale as to what medals could be taken, Pound said: ""That is not an issue at all.""Jones, who won five medals at the 2000 Olympics, denies using drugs and says she will take legal action over Conte's allegations"
Radcliffe tackles marathon tasks,"Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe.And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York.Radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon.Radcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as ""impulsive"" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals.""Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens.""It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,"" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner.Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York.For much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose.""She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'"" Yelling told BBC Sport.""You can't change history,"" warned Richards.Back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m.BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race.""There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'"" Richards told BBC Sport.And Yelling says: ""I think this will probably make Paula.""Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption.Radcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time"
Gatlin and Hayes win Owen awards,"""It is such a great honour to win the Jesse Owens Award,"" said Gatlin.Established in 1981, the Jesse Owens Awards - named in honour of the late Olympic great who won four gold medals at the 1936 Berlin Games - are presented annually to the outstanding US male and female track and field performers.American Olympic stars Justin Gatlin and Joanna Hayes have been named the winners of the 2004 Jesse Owens Awards, USA Track & Field's (USATF) top honour.""It is one of the biggest honours in track and field and it is a great end to a great year. "
Radcliffe enjoys winning comeback,"Just Chepkemei and Radcliffe were left in contention as the race came into the final few miles.But it was Radcliffe who managed to dredge up a final sprint to see off Chepkemei in the closest finish in the race's history and in the process make a huge step in erasing the disappointment she suffered in Athens.  The Kenyan put in several bursts of speed to throw off Radcliffe but the Briton managed to hang in.Radcliffe decided only recently to run in the race and many had doubted whether she had sufficiently recovered from her Olympic ordeal just 11 weeks ago.""It's a good way to end the year,"" she said"
