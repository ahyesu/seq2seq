Fears raised over ballet future,"A spokeswoman for the RAD said: ""It is our responsibility to re-ignite the passion and nurture young dancers for the long-term future of ballet.The RAD have launched a new competition to try and reverse the decline in British ballet.New research from the Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) has found fewer children over the age of 10 are attending ballet classes and taking exams in the discipline.Fewer children in the UK are following in the dainty footsteps of dancers like Darcey Bussell, and carving out potential careers as ballet dancers.The RAD found that the number of youngsters taking their ballet exams drops by almost 70% after the age of 10 or 11.But a spokesman for the English National Ballet told BBC News that although only two out of their 12 principal dancers were British, around a quarter of the company's dancers were from the UK.""It's not a very cool thing to do when you go to 'big' school and I think you have to be very focused on ballet to want to carry on doing it,"" she said.Ms Trew, who runs a dance school in Gateshead, admitted it would be ""very difficult"" to reverse the trend and said many young ballet dancers were no longer willing to make the sacrifices to succeed.Currently, only two out of 16 principal dancers at the Royal Ballet - Darcey Bussell and Jonathan Cope - are British, compared to 16 of the 21 principals in 1985.Aimed at children aged 10 to 13, it is hoped the contest will help keep British ballet evolving.""What better way to reignite a passion for ballet than to let them experience the thrill of performance?""And there are fears that if the trend is not reversed, there could be fewer British ballet stars in the future"

Redford's vision of Sundance,"Redford wanted Sundance to be a platform for independent film-makers, but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream.""People started to say we had gone mainstream and Hollywood, but actually Hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film,"" he adds.But Redford knows this and started the Sundance TV Channel in an effort to reach a wider audience.While Redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent, the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic.With them the celebrities came, then the paparazzi - and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone,"" explains Redford.But Redford is not worried.""Once independent film had a place where the work could be seen, suddenly the merchants came.Smaller festivals like Slamdance and XDance, which take place during the same week in Park City, are competing for Sundance's limelight.""The point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them.""Sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say 'it's just a film by so-and so'.""""It's the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration,"" he says.Redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the American media fails to reflect, particularly how the US is perceived internationally"

"DVD review: I, Robot","Will Smith co-stars alongside more CGI robots than you can count and as a thrill-a-minute kind of action film, it's perfectly adequate.Unusually for this kind of film, the extras don't solely concentrate on the special effects.But as long as you're not expecting a documentary, live with it: King Arthur is a fun, exciting, totally shallow experience and looks excellent.Only one man recognises that robots are a threat to humanity - but that's fine because it only takes one man to save the day in the thriller I, Robot.Admit it, the fact that this is one of the shows Alan Titchmarsh left Ground Force to present did mean that you expected something equally frothy.It's at its best in its battle scenes which are well done and are also the best part of the Making Of extra"

Dutch watch Van Gogh's last film,"The last film to be made by the slain Dutch director Theo van Gogh, called 06/05, has been premiered in The Hague.Van Gogh's movie mixes real images of the day of Fortuyn's murder with a fictional plot about Dutch intelligence services conspiring to silence the politician.Earlier this year, Van Gogh made a film accusing Islam of promoting violence against women.Van Gogh was shot and stabbed to death in Amsterdam six weeks ago.Members of Van Gogh's family and celebrities attended the screening of 06/05, based on the murder of the anti-immigration politician Pim Fortuyn.The story unfolds through the eyes of a freelance photographer who unwittingly takes pictures revealing the involvement of Dutch authorities in Fortuyn's murder"

Director Nair's Vanity project,"Indian film director Mira Nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make William Makepeace Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair - as the book has been a favourite through her life.But Nair said that her film had picked up on the way Thackeray - who was born in India but moved to England as a young man - had seen the world.""First, when I was 16, it was Becky Sharp, who is a completely memorable character, because I recognised myself in her - I recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies, who wanted to buck the system that they were in,"" she said.""It was serendipity really - I was offered Vanity Fair by the studio Focus Features, who had distributed Monsoon Wedding,"" Nair told BBC World Service's Masterpiece programme.Nair also defended her decision to cast an American actress - Reese Witherspoon - as Becky Sharp, despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are British or Irish.But Nair said that, though this had created the need for some filming tricks, it had in fact also helped the film.The film has a new ending, with Becky Sharp running off for a new life in India.Nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film, which she has - controversially - made in a Bollywood style, including two song-and-dance routines in the film's second half.""As I got older and read it, I think it was Thackeray's clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society, the fact that he was born in India but came to England as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider, and yet he was an insider.""It was a self-fulfilling prophesy - when I first met her husband [actor Ryan Philippe], I said 'knock her up, won't you, I need some flesh on the girl',"" she joked.This was, for me, about Becky Sharp being, eventually, a full-blown woman through the course of the film.The book is one of the classics of English literature - the story of scheming 19th Century social climber Becky Sharp, played in the film by Reese Witherspoon.""They offered me their next-best thing, not realising that Vanity Fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since I was 16 years old in an Irish Catholic boarding school in India.""""I cast intuitively - in my films I cast as many non-actors as I cast actors,"" she said"

Tautou film tops Cesar prize nods,"Last November a court judged the film was too American to compete in French film festivals.French film A Very Long Engagement has received 12 nominations for France's Cesar film awards, despite a recent ruling it was ""not French enough"".Other films in the best film category include Police drama 36, Quai Des Orfevres, Arnaud Desplechin's Kings And Queen, Abdellatif Kechiche's L'Esquive and France's number one film at the 2004 box-office The Chorus.The ruling meant the movie - which was filmed in France and used French actors and technicians - was not eligible to compete for French prizes.But the Cesar organisers modified their rules to allow the film to compete.The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, received best actress, picture and director nominations"
Hollywood ready for Oscars night,"Eastwood has won best director once before, for Unforgiven in 1993.UK critics still favour The Aviator for best film, but believe the best director title will generate a close fought battle between Eastwood and Martin Scorsese.Scorsese has never won the best director prize, despite four previous nominations for films including Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Gangs of New York.""Chris has a sense of humour and everything he says is really said humorously,"" Cates said.Most experts predict the twice-nominated Jamie Foxx will win best actor for his portrayal of singer Ray Charles, while Vera Drake star Imelda Staunton looks likely to lose out in the best actress field to Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby.The 40-year-old comic has already promised not to swear live on air during the show.If the 74-year-old does win, he will become the oldest person ever to be named best director at the ceremony.Details have also emerged of the contents of this year's gift bags, which are given to nominees and presenters on the night.A recent poll of US pundits found Eastwood's boxing drama had become the new favourite to win best film over the Howard Hughes biopic.""We are pulling out all the stops,"" said John Miller, chief of counterterrorism at the Los Angeles Police Department.Actor and comedian Chris Rock will host the event, which will be broadcast with a seven-second time delay to allow censors to cut out any unsuitable content"
Animation charms Japan box office,"It has registered the highest opening weekend takings of any Japanese film in the country, according to trade publication Screen Daily.The film won the Golden Osella for outstanding technical contribution at this year's Venice Film Festival.Oscar-winning director Hayao Miyazaki's latest film has set a new Japanese box office record, with 1.5bn yen ($14.3m) in two days, according to reports.Its two-day takings represented 1.1 million cinema admissions, Screen Daily said"
US box office set for record high,"Sony Pictures, responsible for hits like Spiderman 2 and The Grudge, are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years, with $1 billion-plus in sales for the third consecutive year.Ticket sales at the US box office are predicted to break records this year, with figures expected to reach $9.4 billion, beating 2002's all-time high.Although admissions have actually fallen this year, the predicted high is down to increasing ticket prices.Warner Inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around $1.25 billion, with Disney at number three.This year some of the biggest hits such as The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9/11 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters.Jeff Blake said: ""We had a really diverse slate this year, and... certainly we pulled off one of the surprises with Grudge."
Low-budget film wins Cesar,"A film that follows a group of alienated youth in a Paris suburb as they prepare to perform an 18th Century play has won France's top cinema award.US film Lost in Translation won the award for best foreign feature.The Chorus, a film about a schoolteacher who introduces an unruly classroom to the pleasures of classical singing, won two awards - for best music and best sound.Kechiche said he made the film because he ""wanted to show people we don't normally see at the cinema"".A Very Long Engagement, a World War I drama featuring Audrey Tautou, won five Cesar awards"

Foxx and Swank take actors awards,"Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank have won the Screen Actors Guild Awards for best male and female film actors, boosting their Oscars hopes this month.Swank triumphed for playing a gutsy female boxer in Million Dollar Baby.Both Foxx and Swank are now considered to be among the favourites to get Oscars - the Hollywood's ultimate prize.Swank, too, was full of praise for her director and co-star Clint Eastwood.Modest wine country comedy Sideways knocked out favourites Million Dollar Baby and The Aviator by taking the top prize for best cast performance.""I bow down to you,"" Swank said to the 74-year-old Eastwood.Veteran actor Morgan Freeman took the best supporting actor award for playing a prize-fighter turned gym manager in Million Dollar Baby.He also praised the film director: ""Thank you for Taylor Hackford for taking a chance with an African-American film"

UK debut for Kevin Spacey movie,"""Bobby Darin was one of the greatest entertainers the world has ever known, and yet, because he died young, he's been kind of forgotten,"" said Spacey at the premiere.Spacey, 45, wrote, directed and starred in the film, inspired by the life of 1950s croooner Bobby Darin.""This is my tribute to someone I think was a remarkable talent,"" said Spacey, who, as Darin, sings all 18 songs on the film soundtrack.""I knew absolutely nothing about Bobby Darin before this film, but now I'm a huge fan,"" said Bosworth, who attended the premiere with British boyfriend Orlando Bloom.Hollywood stars Kevin Spacey and Kate Bosworth attended the British premiere of new film, Beyond the Sea, in London's Leicester Square on Thursday.Spacey, a double Oscar-winner, has long been fascinated by the story of singer Bobby Darin"
Box office blow for Alexander,"Director Oliver Stone's historical epic Alexander has failed in its bid to conquer the box office, entering the US film charts at number six.Last week Oliver Stone's film met with scathing reviews from US critics.Top of the box office for a second week was action movie National Treasure.In Sweden last Thursday, to pick up a lifetime achievement award at the Stockholm International Film Festival, Stone expressed the hope that Alexander might be better appreciated in Europe.The swords and sandals blockbuster, rumoured to have cost more than $150m (£79m) to make, earned just $13.5 (£7m) over three days at the US box office.But novelist Gore Vidal defended the film, saying it was ""barrier-breaking"" for its frank depiction of bisexuality"

Ocean's Twelve raids box office,"Ocean's Twelve, the crime caper sequel starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, has gone straight to number one in the US box office chart.The sequel narrowly beat its 2001 predecessor, Ocean's Eleven which took $38.1m (£19.8m) on its opening weekend and $184m (£95.8m) in total.A remake of the 1960s film, starring Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, Ocean's Eleven was directed by Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh.Ocean's Twelve box office triumph marks the fourth-biggest opening for a December release in the US, after the three films in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.Soderbergh returns to direct the hit sequel which reunites Clooney, Pitt and Roberts with Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Elliott Gould.A milder review in the New York Times dubbed the sequel ""unabashedly trivial"""
Indie film nominations announced,"Considine is also nominated for a best supporting actor award for My Summer of Love.Joining Vera Drake and Dead Man's Shoes in the running for best film are My Summer of Love, climbing documentary Touching the Void and zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead.Shane Meadows and Kevin McDonald, both former winners of the Douglas Hickox Award (for Best Directorial Debut) won best director nominations.Also in the running for a clutch of awards are My Summer of Love and the stalker drama Enduring Love.Mike Leigh's award-winning abortion drama Vera Drake has scooped seven nominations at this year's British Independent Film Awards.The Australian star faces competition from Daniel Craig (Enduring Love), Phil Davis (Vera Drake), Ian Hart (Blind Fight) and Dead Man's Shoes' star Paddy Considine.But the Venice winner faces stiff competition from Shane Meadows' critically acclaimed Dead Man's Shoes, which received eight nominations"

DVD review: Spider-Man 2,"The films look well transferred to DVD, though none has extras.It's a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good.This disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film.The other universal rule is that DVDs of superhero films will have Making Of features only about the effects.This set has the first season of Buck (Gil Gerard) and Wilma's (Erin Gray) tongue-in-cheek adventures and it's all as camp and gaudy as you remember.The US DVD has this and the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price.The bigger omission, though, is that there are no extras.Sometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than 34 John Wayne films ranging from the Westerns and war movies to The Quiet Man"
Baby becomes new Oscar favourite,"Clint Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby has become the new favourite to win best picture at the Oscars on Sunday.Million Dollar Baby has seven nominations while The Aviator has 11.In the supporting categories, Cate Blanchett is tipped to win for her performance as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, while Morgan Freeman is favourite to take home his first ever Oscar, for Million Dollar Baby.The Aviator has scored a best director nomination for Martin Scorsese, who has never won an Oscar, while stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett are both nominated for acting Oscars.According to pundits, the film has overtaken previous favourite The Aviator, with Eastwood also tipped to take the best director award.Anne Thompson of the Hollywood Reporter said that Million Dollar Baby was ""heart-wrenching"".Its star Hilary Swank is favourite to win best actress while Jamie Foxx is tipped to win best actor for Ray.""It is the most nominated film, and the most nominated movie has won best picture 18 times out of the last 20 years"

US TV cuts nudity from BBC film,"It is not worth showing ""non-essential"" nude scenes when indecency complaints are ""aggressively pursued"" by US TV watchdogs, said PBS' Jacoba Atlas.A US TV network is editing BBC Films' Dirty War to avoid showing the front of a nude woman being scrubbed down after a fictional chemical attack.Ms Atlas said PBS could put itself financially at risk if it showed the uncut version of Dirty War, and it could also deter many of its 170 individual stations from airing ""an important film"".PBS said it will use extra footage for its broadcast, showing the woman ""from a more discreet angle"" instead.It is also being screened uncut on US cable channel HBO on 24 January"
Oscars race enters final furlong,"The only people who will know the Oscar winners before they are revealed at the ceremony will be the auditors who are in charge of looking after the ballot count.""We have had rain up until the day before the show many times, but for some reason the Oscar gods always shine on Sunday and we hope they will do so again this year,"" he added.Best actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio is to present a statuette for the first time at the LA ceremony on Sunday.The race for the Oscars entered its final stages as the deadline for voters to choose their winners passed.It is hoped the forecast for Sunday, for cool weather but no rain, will prove accurate.The 5,808 Academy voters had until Tuesday afternoon to return their ballots - any late submissions will not be included in the count"
Aviator 'creator' in Oscars snub,"Up to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby failed to trim their credits - so the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (Ampas) has done it for them.At the Golden Globes, Mr Evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with DiCaprio, director Martin Scorsese, Mr Mann and Mr King.The Oscars organisers have picked two of The Aviator's four producers to be nominated for best film.But he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film Oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees.Ampas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after Shakespeare in Love's victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards.The Aviator's nominated producers are Michael Mann and Graham King - with Mr Evans and Sandy Climan, Mr Mann's former deputy, left off"

Franz man seeks government help,"The government shouldn't ""fund"" music - it should ""invest"" in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.Yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.I do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies!Areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants, so why not music?The solution Mr Kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations, like Save the Music in the US.If Alex Kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.There is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy.Perhaps we could financially penalise really bad Pop Idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers.As long as the Government was funding real talent it would be a great move.Pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities  I agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but I am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer.Music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff.We already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music.Call it a tax on music ""pollution"", if you like.""But so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well.""Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos has called for more government help for musicians, while taking part in an Edinburgh Lectures discussion.Getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.I would hate to see more Pop Idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that Alex talked about.However, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they're a musician.Kapranos said there was a general ""hostility"" towards classical music, adding: ""There is very little done to break that hostility other than Classic FM.""If they can fund football, why not fund music?The government has enough problems funding schools and health services.If labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn't have to fork out a great deal.I think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state?Kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss Scotland's role in making 21st Century music.Rather than expecting the government - i.e.Many years ago, this was the case with the US NEA, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting"

Scissor Sisters triumph at Brits,"Angels is a great song, but not the best song of the last 25 years.Whilst Angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in Robbie's repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years.Best song of the last 25 years?Best song in the last 25 years?I think Angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but I don't think its the best song from the past 25 years!Robbie Williams' Angels was named the best song of the past 25 years.It's alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years???Best song in 25 years?Although Angels is a good song I think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years.A great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years?That's why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years.Angels is without doubt a great song but I really don't think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on Robbies' goodlooks than the actual song!!!The best song of the past 25 years?I've nothing against Robbie, I actually like his music, but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year?If this is the best song of the last 25 years then the British Music industry is in trouble.The initial list was very weak anyway, but Angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!!But it is no way the best song of the past 25 years!I'm actually embarrassed to be British if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years!!Booo hisss  Angels, best song?I very much doubt that 'Angels' was even the best song of the week that it came out.What a load of crap, best song in the last 25 years - I don't think so!!While I am biassed in that I thought Love Will Tear Us Apart should have won, in all seriousness, I think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty.Best song in 25 years, you must be joking.Only the best song to be up for nomination at the Brits.Why a half-baked cheesy ditty like Angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on Pop Idol for example, and by whom), should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me.I am a regular listener to Radio 2 but I don't recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn't know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly NOT the best song of the last 25 years.There is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it's a travesty.Ok I like Robbie and Angels is a decent song.I think that although Robbie Williams is a good performer, that Angels isn't really that good a song.Angels is a fantastic song.Yes Angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning.""Angels"" isn't a bad song.Personally I find Angels by Robbie Williams to be one of the most irritating songs I have ever heard!Best of the last 25 years?I am a huge Robbie fan and love that song.Think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than Angels.There must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more.I think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.There must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids.Williams' track beat songs by Will Young, Queen, Kate Bush and Joy Division in a vote by BBC Radio 2 listeners to mark 25 years of the UK music industry ceremony.But I think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list.A sad day for music  It's not the type of music I normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, I recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people.Angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it.The success of Angels at this years Brits reflects poorly on the state of British music over the last 25 years.It is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.McFly won the best pop act prize, and Gwen Stefani picked up the best international female artist award.I find it hard to believe that 'Angels' is the best we have to show for the past 25 years!The flamboyant act scored a hat-trick in the international categories, winning the best group, best album and best newcomer awards.What about all the REAL artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless, but Robbie Williams doesn't even come close.It should have been Joy Division.Those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while Angels remains yet another pop song.it's a terrible song, voted for by the masses who don't have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music.Little Britain comedy duo Matt Lucas and David Walliams presented the best song prize to Robbie Williams dressed as his former Take That colleagues Gary Barlow and Howard Donald, leading him to quip he was ""always the talented man of the band"".Some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but Angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.The song is overplayed and oversentimental.Granted angels is a good song, however it really wasn't up against any other proper competition.Right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was Will Young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn't that good!There were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win!Much better songs and more timeless.Phil Collins doesn't deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote?Also, why weren't the Stones there, David Bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than Angels...I wonder if it was simply the fact that Robbie wasn't getting more awards so they had to make one up for him!The US band, who opened the show with Take Your Mama, won the best international act and newcomer awards, as well as best international album.Franz Ferdinand, who were shortlisted in five categories, won best rock act and best British group, an award they dedicated to late DJ John Peel.It's a mediocre, sentimental and safe song.Keane won best British album and breakthrough act.If this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up.Natasha Bedingfield - in the running for best British female and best pop act - performed with her brother Daniel for the first time at Wednesday's event.A band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than Robbie Williams ever will.Soppy rubbish at best.It just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick Robbie Williams over the beautifully talented Kate Bush and Joy Division.That song has become such a bane to me that I have developed a Pavlovian response to the word 'Angels' where I thrash around, and scream ""no no no no no"" until someone tells me ""the radio's off"".It seems obvious to me that people who like Robbie are people who don't particularly like music all that much.The song makes me calm and serene and happy.The Queen's song was lackluster, and apart from Kate Bush, the other choices were pathetic!Will Young won the best single prize for Your Game.Robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non-fans know the words to angels.If you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don't you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote.I think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people.Viewers of digital music TV channel MTV Base voted Stone the winner in the best urban act category.I'm rapidly redifining 'best' in my own head now to mean 'most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning'.There's not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling.Sure Robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record.It's a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups.They weren't cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think.Robbie was a deserved winner.Why must 'best' always come down to most commercially popular?Just like Robbie.After beating Amy Winehouse, Jamelia, Natasha Bedingfield and PJ Harvey to the best British female prize, Joss Stone said: ""I don't know what to say.Glasgow group Franz Ferdinand won two prizes, as did Keane and Joss Stone, who was voted best urban act by digital TV viewers.Best British male artist winner Mike Skinner - aka The Streets - does not usually attend award ceremonies, but the Birmingham hip-hop artist performed his hit Dry Your Eyes at the ceremony.Whenever the song comes on the radio I turn the radio up, smile and sing along (very badly, that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out).Then again, well done Robbie, good show.But they missed out on best British live act, which went to Muse.Whenever we have these awards it is always 'artists' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...We forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example"
Jamelia's return to the top,"It was her next single, Superstar, that really put her back on the map as one of Britain's most popular female R&B singers, holding her own in a music scene dominated by US artists such as Beyonce and Ashanti.The Birmingham-born singer, full name Jamelia Davis, was signed to a record label at the age of 15 and released her first single So High at 18.His involvement with the song meant not only was it given massive publicity but it was also greeted favourably by a new audience who would not usually listen to R&B.She released four number ones from her 2000 album Drama, including the top five hit Money featuring the vocals of reggae artist Beenie Man.Superstar was followed by Thank You, winner of best single at the 2004 Mobos, which reached number two in the UK charts.During her absence R&B music exploded and a whole host of female artists were on the scene, meaning Jamelia had to once again prove herself.While she originally planned to get back to work pretty swiftly after giving birth it was actually two years before she released another single.R&B star Jamelia had three Brit nominations to go with her triple triumph at last year's Mobo awards"
Cult band Kasabian surge forward,"""British music needs a kick up the arse and Britain needs a new band to breathe life into the British people again,"" declared Kasabian's singer Tom Meighan.Meighan grew up in Leicester with Kasabian songwriter/guitarist Sergio Pizzorno and bassist Chris Edwards, a trio which began making music from the age of 17.But music needs us as well.""""We take our music seriously, definitely, but we want to have fun with it,"" said Pizzorno.Indie dance band Kasabian built up a cult following throughout 2004 to secure three Brit Award nominations.The four-piece Leicester band blends dark electronics with rock, earning Kasabian places on the best British group, rock act and live act shortlists.Kasabian moved into a remote farmhouse in Rutland to record their debut album, benefiting from its isolation but also managing to sneak in a few parties while they were there.""We saw his long sideburns and thought 'hey, he looks the part, we'll ask him,'"" said Meighan.""We got a computer and we cut rock'n'roll up, because there's no point in going back to how it was,"" said Meighan.""This is not a job to us,"" added Meighan.Signed to the RCA record label, Kasabian tested the water with two singles, Club Foot and LSF, which reached numbers 19 and 10 in the UK singles chart respectively"
Brits debate over 'urban' music,"And so what of ""Urban"" music?Urban is a nonsense term - music of black origin?""Urban"" seems to be the new name for all styles of black music.If there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in Britain, I think that's where you can call it urban - that's where this new sub-category, or uber-category, has come from.Stop puting it all in brackets and let's just call it music, and let's especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin, this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.We are urban music as far as I'm concerned.Urban is PC version for saying black music.If Joss Stone can be accepted within the urban music community, I think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too.They are both 10 times better than Joss Stone and both of them have won Urban Music Awards and i think Mobos , but why not Brits????Surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is (historically) considered urban music, irrelevent of the colour of their skin, or where they originate from.Her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is.She makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban.Her music is great soul and surely that is under the 'Urban' banner?Excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding Lenny Kravitz or Hendrix from rock music for being black surely?She did deserve it, but I agree with the comments about urban music.Joss Stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style, just as someone from an inner city, and indeed not from the USA could sing country music.I don't feel like urban music's just been celebrated by [Joss Stone] winning or her being nominated, or by the Brits acknowledging that there's an urban music scene because it's all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day.It's music, you like it or you don't.The word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it's wrong.A type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city, and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life.The great thing about urban music is that there's a big range.Urban is just a word that's come about recently to describe ""black"" music that's become popular now.Black people should lead the music they invented .Ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider 'music of black origin', these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity.Look at all the TV broadcasters, unable to reach young people without condesending, they simply play some 'urban' music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music.You have said it: there is music you like and music you don't like - who cares what label you put on it?The real question is would Joss Stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black?The very term 'Music of Black Origin' has confused and offended many people.What urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background.So what if Joss Stone won the Urban awards.All this ""urban"" and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored.The music industry isn't championing music from our particular genre very well anyway.The term 'urban' therefore, has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first 'black' or 'white' thereby rendering the issue colourblind.It appears that the use of 'black' or 'white' in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable.If anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (I think probably should include Hip-Hop, Soul & Funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the Streets, although Dizzee Rascal stakes a good claim  She definitely deserved to win a prize, Joss Stone's albums are quite simply amazing, easily better than anything else that was released last year.The term urban in reference to a music genre in UK has developed, in part, from the controversy surrounding the branding of the MOBO Awards.Joss Stone deserved to win an award for her talents, but I don't think it was very 'urban' of her to sing angels with Robbie Williams.How far are the Brits removed from inner-city music and what people are doing?It's a word that's been manufactured in this country and America to describe black music.Joss Stone, a 17-year-old soul singer from Devon, beat Dizzee Rascal, Jamelia, Lemar and The Streets to win best British urban act at the Brit Awards.If we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won, then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is, rather than what it represents.This whole debate about what is urban, what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who weren't nominated or didn't win.In truth it's a lazy term to categorise music that you don't really understand.If people want to call it urban, why not?Ignore the labels, it is what it is, just music.Why does music have to be put into a genre?Music made in the inner cities?Whilst I agree that the term 'urban' is open to interpretation, it strikes me as simply weird that Joss Stone has won.So, what you're saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isn't black.I love Joss to bits and don't care what her branding is - it's amazing music, full stop.If Lemar, who makes music which is less soulful than Joss' work won, he might have said nothing.I'm not really comfortable with the word urban.This is particularly strange given the existence of the Asian Music Awards.There's only two kinds of music: good and bad.I demand a prize for rural music!Urban as a genre is very broad"
Row threatens Hendrix museum plan,"Janie Hendrix, the guitarist's stepsister, said the family were still hoping the guitarist would be honoured by having a road named after him.The foundation moved the building, in which Al Hendrix lived between 1953 and 1956, when the land it was built on was to be developed for housing in 2002.Mr Goldman said the authority had promised the house could remain on its new site and be turned into a memorial and community centre.""The mayor is going to go down as the mayor who destroyed Jimi Hendrix's house,"" said Ray Rae Marshall of the James Marshall Hendrix Foundation.Hendrix was widely considered one of the most important guitarists of his time.Hendrix supporters hoped to turn the home into a museum for the guitarist.Now Mr Goldman is calling for the authority to pay to move the building to Seattle's central district, where Hendrix grew up.Seattle officials said no such deal had been offered"
No jail for singer Courtney Love,"In a separate case relating to the same incident, Ms Love was sentenced to 18 months in drug rehabilitation for being under the influence of cocaine and opiates.Ms Love was originally charged with the more serious offence of assault with a deadly weapon, but that was reduced to assault.Judge Rand Rubin said she must:  - Spend three years on probation - Have one year's anger management counselling - Have one year's drug rehabilitation - Do 100 hours community service - Pay $1,000 (£535) fine - Have random drug tests - Go to three Narcotics Anonymous meetings per week  In the drugs case, she was sentenced to 18 months probation, to run concurrently with the probation for the assault.The assault charge stemmed from April 2004, when Ms Love found musician Kristin King in her boyfriend's home.The ex-Hole singer's lawyer Howard Weitzman said Ms Love had ""turned her life around"" and she was ""clean and sober"".Singer Courtney Love has been spared jail for assault and drug offences, but must serve three years probation"
Rapper Kanye West's shrewd soul,"Leaving his Chicago art school after only one year - a move which would later inspire the title of his album - West began his music career co-producing songs for artists Mase and the Madd Rapper.West was shortlisted for 10 Grammys - including nominations for artist and album of the year - and took the best hip-hop artist, producer and album titles at last year's Music of Black Origin (Mobo) Awards.Hip-hop producer No ID encouraged West to sample old soul and R&B hits then revive them with an updated sound, an approach that would become his trademark.West's account of the accident sampled Chaka Khan's hit Through the Fire to become the heart of his completed solo album The College Dropout.US hip-hop star Kanye West - who leads the race for this year's Grammys with 10 nominations - rose to prominence by producing songs for artists such as Jay-Z and Alicia Keys.As their success attracted further production work for Jay-Z ('03 Bonnie & Clyde) and artists such as Ludacris (Stand Up) and Alicia Keys (You Don't Know My Name), West announced plans for a solo album.This drew the attention of superstar rapper Jay-Z, who signed West up to his Roc-A-Fella record label to produce numerous artists on his roster.Now a respected rapper and producer in the influential field of hip-hop, Kanye West is unlikely to regret his decision to leave college early.The resulting song, Through the Wire, became West's first UK hit in April 2004 and subsequent album The College Dropout became a transatlantic success, both critically and commercially.But his solo career almost ended before it began after a near-fatal car crash left West with his jaw wired shut in 2002"
Singer Christina Aguilera to wed,"In 2002, Aguilera won best pop collaboration for the hit track Lady Marmalade with Lil' Kim, Maya and Pink, and last year she picked up the award for best female pop vocal performance for Beautiful.New York-born Aguilera reached number one in the UK with her debut hit Genie in a Bottle in October 1999.Pop star Christina Aguilera is to marry music executive Jordan Bratman, the singer's agent has confirmed.Aguilera burst onto the pop scene in 1999, winning a best new artist Grammy in 2000.Bratman, 26, proposed to Grammy-winning singer Aguilera, 23, on holiday at an undisclosed location"
Brits return Keane to number one,"The debut album, which took the best British album title at the Brits on Tuesday, moved up seven places from number eight to number one.Last week's number one album Tourist, by Athlete, fell to number three.There are currently six re-released Elvis' tracks occupying spots in the top 40 singles chart including Are You Lonesome Tonight at number 20, It's Now or Never at number 27 and Jailhouse Rock at number 37.Their self-titled album moved from 13 to number four.The track, from their current album How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, pushed Eminem's Like Toy Soldiers from number one to number three"
U2's desire to be number one,"But they still want more.They have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it.The band have done ""everything in their considerable powers"" to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world, according to Q magazine editor Paul Rees.We don't want to be thought of as a veteran band.""""The challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make records the whole world will listen to,"" Bono recently said.U2, who have won three prestigious Grammy Awards for their hit Vertigo, are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world.The end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements.They are, perhaps, alone as the only rock band that has got better with age.""They also have to want it.In 1987, The Joshua Tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including Where the Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For and With Or Without You.The stadium-filling, anthemic sound was U2's aim from the start, and their third album, War, saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the Atlantic, going to number one in the UK and 12 in the US.He added: ""They are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up.Their new album, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in Dublin and 17 years after The Joshua Tree cemented their place on the all-time rock A-list.These came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music, plus wildly extravagant stage shows, while still trying to retain their mass appeal.Vertigo, the first single from the new album, went straight into the UK singles chart at number one, knocking Eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit.Songs like Sunday Bloody Sunday and New Year's Day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which Bono rejected as a cliche.Before the release of How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, they had sold 125 million albums around the world"
Lasting influence of legend Charles,"If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers.Ray Charles, who has won a string of posthumous Grammy Awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.""I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever.""Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a ""brother in every sense of the word"".Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes.His sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent UK beat and R&B scenes.More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was.Without Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett.After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What'd I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael's sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack"
Grammys honour soul star Charles,"His song Here We Go Again with Norah Jones won record of the year and best pop vocal collaboration, while Heaven Help Us All with Gladys Knight picked up best gospel performance.Vertigo by rock giants U2 won three trophies - best rock song, best short video and best rock vocal performance by a duo or group.Rod Stewart also won the first Grammy of his career, getting the best traditional pop album award for Stardust...Keys, looking to replicate her Grammys success of 2002, when she won five, picked up best R&B song for You Don't Know My Name and best R&B album for The Diary of Alicia Keys.She also shared the award for best R&B vocal performance by a duo or group with Usher for My Boo.Mayer also won best male pop vocal performance.Britney Spears picked up her first ever Grammy for her song Toxic, which was named best dance recording.Charles' last album, Genius Loves Company, a collection of duets that has sold more than two million copies, was named album of the year and best pop vocal album.Kanye West dominated the rap categories, winning best rap song for Jesus Walks and best rap album for The College Dropout.Usher's other victories were for best contemporary R&B album for Confessions and best rap/sung collaboration for Yeah!, featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris.Charles, who died in 2004, got honours including record and album of the year, while Alicia Keys and actor Jamie Foxx performed a musical tribute to him.But in one of the night's biggest shocks, he lost out in the battle to be named best new artist to pop rock act Maroon 5"
Abba reunite for musical premiere,"Original Abba member Bjorn Ulvaeus set about translating the musical into the band's mother tongue for the celebrated homecoming, alongside Swedish artist Niklas Stromstedt.The musical, which has become a global phenomenon, will be performed in Swedish for the first time.Almost all of Abba's original songs, which have sold more than 350 million records worldwide, were written and recorded in English.The premiere marks Abba's first public reunion since the legendary band's acrimonious break-up in the early 1980s.The original stars of Swedish pop quartet Abba have reunited for the home premiere of hit musical Mamma Mia!It is the first time in almost 20 years that the four, Bjorn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, have met publicly"

Black Sabbath top rock album poll,"The band once fronted by Ozzy Osbourne led a poll of Kerrang!Osbourne said the band's success in the Kerrang!Black Sabbath have topped a list of the best British rock albums of all time.poll was a triumph for British rock.Despite being disliked by many critics, Black Sabbath's subsequent albums included multi-million sellers but internal rows led to Osbourne leaving in 1979.editor Ashley Bird said: ""It's amazing to see so many incredible homegrown albums in one list, and without any of the abysmal fashion bands that currently clog up the music scene.Their debut was a UK top 10 hit in 1970 and sold more than a million copies in the US.The band continued without Osbourne, who went on to solo success but also had to battle alcoholism and legal action over his music allegedly inciting teenagers to commit suicide.Formed by four teenage friends in the West Midlands in the late 1960s, Black Sabbath are one of Britain's most successful heavy rock bands.Osbourne, who bit off the head of a live bat on stage in 1982, rejoined the band to play the Live Aid charity concert in 1985"

German music in a 'zombie' state,"Tim Renner, the head of Universal Music Germany until last year, told BBC World Service's The Music Biz programme that the country's music industry was now struggling to survive.Mr Zombic also called for a change to the perception in Germany that private copying of music is not a problem.""I don't agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact, especially in regard to Germany talent, the market is quite successful.""The music market in Germany peaked in 1997, with sales of 2.6bn euros (£1.8bn).The German music business - the third largest in the world - is ""in the state of a zombie"" because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy, a leading industry figure has said.""The problem the music industry has got is that they aren't willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out,"" he stated.However, Peter Zombic, the managing director of the International Federation of Phonographic Industry in Germany, said he did not feel the situation was as ""dramatic"" as Mr Renner believed.""So the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie.""""We have a severe problem with piracy, especially internet piracy, and we also have a severe problem of private copying.""At that time it was not successful, because of the advent of piracy - it was the Napster time, when P2P services became popular"
Musical treatment for Capra film,"The classic film It's A Wonderful Life is to be turned into a musical by the producer of the controversial hit show Jerry Springer - The Opera.Mr Thoday said the idea of turning the film into a musical had been an ambition of his for almost 20 years.Mr Thoday managed to buy the rights to the story from Van Doren Stern's family in 1999, following Mr Brown's success with Spend Spend Spend.He is working with Steve Brown, who wrote the award-winning musical Spend Spend Spend"
Famed music director Viotti dies,"Viotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milan's La Scala and the Vienna State Opera.The last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore.At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venice's famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive.His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996"

How the Academy Awards flourished,"The first film to win was Wings, which starred Clara Bow in the only silent movie to win the big award.The Academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines.Writer Dudley Nichols refused his Academy Award in 1935 for his screenplay for The Insider because the Writers' Guild was striking at the time.The first televised ceremony was in 1953, with Bob Hope as the MC.Opal was murdered in 1979.The first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist Sidney Skolsky used it to describe Katherine Hepburn's first best actress win in 1934.In support of the war effort, the Academy handed out plaster Oscar statuettes during WWII.For the first 10 years or so, the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm, but in 1940 the winners were published in the Los Angeles Times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results.Douglas Fairbanks Sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards.HOW IT ALL STARTED The first Academy Awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel - just over the road from their modern day home.She was later revealed to be Native American actress Maria Cruz.Some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the Academy, receipt of an Academy Award nomination, achievement of unique distinction, earning of special merit, or making an outstanding contribution to film.After the war, winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing.Capra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for It Happened One Night.The ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses.CONTROVERSIES AND OTHER GAFFES Three people have refused Oscars, including actor George C Scott who said the whole thing was ""demeaning"".The death of Martin Luther King saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan.Winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out.The trophy was designed by MGM art director Cedric Gibbons.As a result the sealed envelope system was introduced, leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today.One popular story is that Academy librarian Margaret Herrick said the statue looked like her uncle Oscar"
Hoffman hits out over modern film,"Hoffman also said he stopped working a few years ago and moved into directing and writing.The 67-year-old also said he stopped working a few years ago because he lost his ""spark"" for acting.The star of Rain Man and Tootsie said the film culture was ""in the craphouse"" at a press conference on Tuesday.Hoffman is in the UK to publicise his new comedy, Meet the Fockers, which also stars Robert De Niro, Barbra Streisand and Ben Stiller.Recently, Hoffmann has returned to film, with roles in I Heart Huckabees, Finding Neverland and now Meet the Fockers, which is the sequel to Meet the Parents.""You can tell how much money the film is going to make by how it does on the first weekend.He said: ""I just lost that spark I always had.Hollywood legend Dustin Hoffman has hit out at the quality of current films and theatre productions"
Johnny Depp: The acting outlaw,"He played a much more serious, sensitive role in his next major film, Donnie Brasco, where he portrayed an undercover cop infiltrating a mafia ring.But it was TV that first made Depp a star.Johnny Depp, whose latest role was Peter Pan creator JM Barrie in Finding Neverland, is celebrated as one of Hollywood's most maverick talents.In 1984 he started his film career playing a doomed teenager in horror film Nightmare On Elm Street.The theme of children's literature in Depp's career - and his long association with Tim Burton - are set to continue in his next role, playing Willy Wonka in a remake of Roald Dahl's classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Another role under Burton, Ed Wood, starred Depp as the crazed cult film-maker Wood, in 1994.Depp has become an unlikely major star, given his preference for taking dark and idiosyncratic roles instead of surefire box office hits.Two years later he played a soldier in Oliver Stone's Vietnam epic Platoon.His latest role in Finding Neverland explored JM Barrie's relationship with Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her children.He has had a long-running working relationship with the equally unconventional director Tim Burton"

UK 'world's biggest music buyer',"The growth in the DVD market and a sharp increase in sales of digital music ensured a strong market in the US.But global sales of recorded music were flat in 2004, with growing sales in DVD music videos offset by online and physical piracy in major markets.The UK music industry recorded an overall 3% increase in volume sales, mostly due to its robust albums market.However, world music sales declined by 1.3% to $33.6 billion (£17.7 billion).Overall sales were driven by new UK-signed artists such as Keane, Katie Melua and Scissor Sisters, whose debut album sold almost 1.6 million copies in the UK.Around 26,000 albums are released in the UK each year, making Britain second only to the US in terms of the number of releases.""A slew of great new British artists have met UK music fans' demand for great music,"" said BPI chairman Peter Jameson.The UK CD albums market grew by 4.5% in 2004 with a record 174.6 million units sold"

Vera Drake leads UK Oscar hopes,"Kate Winslet was also nominated in the best actress category for her role in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.To be nominated for a film that was released a while ago, I feel so honoured and overwhelmed,"" she said.""It was an extraordinary time making the film and I can't believe what has happened this morning,"" she said.Imelda Staunton was nominated for best actress for her role in the abortion drama, while Leigh received nods for best director and original screenplay.Winslet said she was ""ecstatic"" about the fourth nomination of her career.Cinematographer John Mathieson, who was nominated for Gladiator in 2001, is also up for The Phantom of the Opera.It is also a debut nomination for Staunton, 49, who told BBC News 24 she had not thought the film would appeal to Academy voters.The UK has two contenders in the best live action short film category.John Woodward, chief executive of the UK Film Council, said it was ""extremely heartening"" to see British filmmaking talent recognised on the global stage.Owen has already been made bookmakers' favourite for best supporting actor for the role in Closer that has already clinched him a Golden Globe award.""Britain has a hugely talented industry and these nominations show why National Lottery investment in film pays major dividends for our culture and economy."
Moreno debut makes Oscar mark,"Catalina Sandino Moreno has joined a rare group of actresses who have been nominated for an Oscar for starring in a foreign language film.Sandino Moreno is now being regarded as one of the most promising actresses around at the moment.The Colombian-born actress was the final hope for director Joshua Marston, who scoured the US and Colombia for a lead for Maria Full of Grace.And at the 2004 Berlin Film Festival the jury could not choose between her and Charlize Theron's Oscar winning performance in Monster so gave them a tied award"
Bening makes awards breakthrough,"Film actress Annette Bening is up for an Oscar for her starring role in the award-winning film Being Julia.Bening was the first choice to play the female lead in American Beauty, director Sam Mendes' film debut which was a critical and commercial success - but the actress had to be content with a Bafta award for her strong performance.Bugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for Bening - she married Beatty, with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in Europe.Bening played Virginia Hill, another role which won her high critical acclaim, but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 Oscar nominations.But current film Being Julia has made Bening an award-winning actress rather than the perennial nominee, with success at the Golden Globes.But it was her role opposite Warren Beatty in 1991 gangster flick Bugsy which had the greatest impact.The witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s London sees the eponymous theatrical diva - played by Bening - grow tired of her success and fall for a young American - and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted Academy Award.One of the biggest Oscars buzzes in recent years was for Bening's role as troubled Carolyn Burnham in 1999's American Beauty"
Oscars steer clear of controversy,"While he said the Oscar voting panel were not ""snubbing"" Moore's film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category.""Hollywood doesn't tend to like foreign-language films - no-one's ever tried doing a film in a dead language,"" he said.But Mr Dams said: ""It's not an inflammatory film.Another 'contentious' film, Mr Dams said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm.""They tend to go for films like Titanic, Gladiator, and the Lord of the Rings, films with scale that often aren't too contentious,"" he said.The German film The Downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker, has been recognised in the best foreign film category.Mr Dams said: ""It's a political film, but it's quite fun and punky and well-paced.The film has been a hit around the world.The problem with Mel Gibson's film, he believed, was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in Aramaic, an ancient Middle Eastern language.It has done very well in Germany, and it's a film that portrays Hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster.""If best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front-runners would have had to be Michael Moore's Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ.The Oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer, less contentious cinema"
Kidman wins photographer battle,"Actress Nicole Kidman has won a restraining order against two paparazzi photographers who she claims left her fearful of leaving her Sydney mansion.Kidman was prompted to take action following a reported high-speed car chase with members of the paparazzi in Sydney last weekend.Magistrate Lee Gilmore, who issued the restraining order at Waverley Local Court in Sydney, said she understood the photographers were entitled to earn a living but there had to be limits to their behaviour.Lawyers for Mr Fawcett and Mr McDonald denied that the pair were involved in the chase.Lawyers for the pair denied allegations they had planted the device.According to local newspaper the Daily Telegraph, the incident involved paparazzi driving through red lights and on the wrong side of the road in pursuit of Kidman's vehicle"

Roundabout continues nostalgia trip,"One puppet show that I personally would love to see made into a live action movie is Joe 90.I have fond memories of Bod (not least of which because I look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film.Would have loved to see Dungeons & Dragons made, but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn't come up to scratch.It's all very well and good remaking these classic TV shows and films with all the latest technology for a 'new' audience, but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this, and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it.It maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice, but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as Thunderbirds and Magic Roundabout which are part of our childhood, they are never going to live up to expectation.Part of the reason for the success of such classics as the Magic Roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect.I believe that Childrens classics should be left well alone, and I will not be surprised if the Magic Roundabout does not do well at the Box Office, especially since it will be going up against The Spongebob Squarepants movie, popular among children because it's original, witty, and modern.The thunderbirds film was apalling, not a patch on the puppet series I grew up with and the Magic Roundabout will never be the same without the voice of Eric Thompson.There are plany of modern children's book that would make excellent films or TV programmes, why not use them instead of rehashing the past?Well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like Steve Martin.Personally i'd like to see cartoons such as Transformers, Thundercats and M.A.S.K.It would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of Joe's car.Could Morph hold his own in a big screen movie???The only one that isn't to be remade as yet is Thundercats, which I'd like to see.The Magic Roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.I'm only 27 and don't remember the series from when it was on TV, but have the set on DVD and it's a classic.The new version of The Magic Roundabout, which will be released as Sprung!Personally, I think it shows that no one has any originality any more!Or even Jamie and the Magic Torch....hmmmmm, I could go on and on.Thats the appeal though, it's so innocent (like Chorlton himself) and it would be a real shame if they did remake it.The new big-screen version of The Magic Roundabout, released in the UK on Friday, is the latest attempt to turn children's television into box-office gold.Seems that the film and TV is doing the same now - it's just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them, rather than being daring and trying something new.Should be fun to see on the big screen, if some effort is put in!Just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved.I'd like to see Mr. Benn, with Brad Pitt in the title role.This re-gurgitation of old films and TV shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people's ideas, because it guarantees to bring in the $$$.Films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of Disneyfying everthing, and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place.Perhaps if the remakes were done in a 'Look Around You' mock-authentic style I might be interested ...  Chorton And The Wheelies or Jamie And His Magic Torch; that would be mega!I recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in Danger Mouse that was completely lost on me when I was a child.How about classics like Chorlton and the Wheelies, Rentaghost, Terrahawks, Bod.....oh the list could go on and on!!!Again, like so many of these nostalgia programmes, the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original's cut out paper technique for inventiveness, and was woefully inadequate.Dan Jolin, reviews editor of Empire magazine, says classic children's TV shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.It was only that Thunderbirds The Movie was targetted as a children't movie that really let it down.But then again, it couldn't be better than the original series, could it?My dearest wish, however, is to see a feature length version of Noggin the Nog appear on The Big Screen!!I'd luv to see Willow the Wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late Kenneth Williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same.TV shows such as Battlestar Galactica have new remakes, DJ's are sampling or re-working 70's and 80's music.I'd hate to see Bagpuss with perfect animation - I love that 'done in a shed' clunkiness and you couldn't recreate the magic.All I can say is bring back Danger Mouse, probably the greatest kids' show ever.Love to see Transformers with real actors and CGI.Just imagine what could be achieved by using CGI in a remake of Fingerbobs... the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy, Yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like Fingermouse  Bob the Builder, Postman Pat and Fireman Sam together in an epic adventure of fire, post and bricks.There WAS a new Captain Pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back.And the recent puppet comedy Team America: World Police was in part provoked by its directors' outrage that Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins.Despite Thunderbirds' disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (£22m) but only recouped $21m (£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating.I think remakes are a good idea.The Magic Roundabout is out in the UK on 11 February.Make a movie version of the Banana splits!Or perhaps Robbie Williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of Andy Pandy.With screen versions of The A-Team, The Dukes of Hazzard and even Blake's Seven on the cards, nostalgia is clearly big business.If they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great.The problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach Oliver Postgate's wonderful voices.:-)  Noggin the Nog was one of the best children's programs.It's always nice to see these old toons re-released, but after the abysmal Thunderbirds movie (and the song!)But of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs.It does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made, are film-makers running out of original ideas"
Stars shine on Bafta red carpet,"Keanu Reeves, who presented the best actress award, said being on the red carpet was an ""exciting"" part of his job.He said: ""I am a great admirer of British cinema since the 1930s and 40s, up until now.The 14-year-old said she was hoping to meet DiCaprio and Keanu Reeves but joked that ""they are probably a little too old for me"".Rooting for Staunton in the best actress category was Cate Blanchett, herself nominated for her supporting role as Hollywood icon Katherine Hepburn in The Aviator.She said: ""Never in a million years did I think this was going to happen.British actor Clive Owen, who has won a Golden Globe and a Bafta for his supporting role in Closer, said it ""meant a lot"" to be at the ceremony.He said the ear-piercing welcome was ""unlike anything I've ever encountered.Glamour was also brought to the evening by actress Sienna Miller, supermodel Claudia Schiffer - who was supporting her director husband Matthew Vaughn - Troy actress Diane Kruger and star of the TV programme The OC, Micha Barton.Martin Scorsese, whose movie The Aviator went on to win best film, said being honoured in the UK meant a lot to him.Hollywood stars brought a touch of glamour to London on Saturday for the biggest night in the British film calendar.The biggest cheer of the night was reserved for The Aviator star Leonardo DiCaprio, who paused in the chilly February air to sign autographs for the throngs.The younger stars of British film were also represented in the shape of Emma Watson, who plays Hermione in the Harry Potter films"
Bafta to hand out movie honours,"Staunton is one of the favourites to land the best actress award for her gritty role as a backstreet abortionist in the small-budget film.The Orange British Academy Film Awards will be shown on BBC One at 2010 GMT.British actor Owen is hoping to repeat his Golden Globe success with a best supporting actor award for his role in Closer.Gere, who is presenting the best film award, said: ""It's a big party, I had no idea it was going to be this big.It is up against Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Finding Neverland, The Motorcycle Diaries and British film Vera Drake, which has 11 nominations.Other nominees in the best actress category include Charlize Theron for Monster, Ziyi Zhang for House of Flying Daggers and UK star Kate Winslet, who has two nods for her roles in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Finding Neverland.Movie stars from across the globe are attending this year's Bafta film award ceremony.Mike Leigh is up for the best director award for Vera Drake, alongside Martin Scorsese for The Aviator, Michael Mann for Collateral, Michel Gondry for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Marc Forster for Finding Neverland.British stars Imelda Staunton and Clive Owen are hoping for awards at the Odeon in London's Leicester Square.Hollywood stars Leonardo diCaprio, Pierce Brosnan, Christian Slater and Richard Gere are also in the audience for the biggest night in UK film.Asked whether she was nervous about her best actress nomination she said: ""It's out of my hands, there's nothing I can do"
Stars pay tribute to actor Davis,"""Ossie was my hero, and he still is,"" said Aviator star Alan Alda, a family friend for over forty years.Hollywood stars including Spike Lee, Burt Reynolds and Oscar nominee Alan Alda have paid tribute to actor Ossie Davis at a funeral in New York.Veteran star Ossie Davis, a well-known civil rights activist, died in Miami at the age of 87 on 4 February 2005.""Ossie was a thing of beauty.""""It is hard to fathom that we will no longer be able to call on his wisdom, his humour, his loyalty and his moral strength to guide us in the choices that are yet to be made and the battles that are yet to be fought,"" said Belafonte, himself an ardent civil rights activist who had been friends with Davis for over 60 years.Also present at the service was former US president Bill Clinton and singer Harry Belafonte, who gave the eulogy.He frequently collaborated with director Spike Lee, starring in seven Lee films including Jungle Fever, Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X. Attallah Shabazz, the daughter of activist Malcolm X, recalled the famous eulogy delivered by Davis at her father's funeral.""Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its finest hopes,"" she said, quoting the man she knew as Uncle Ossie"
Aviator and Vera take Bafta glory,"But Vera Drake scored best director for Mike Leigh while Imelda Staunton took the hotly contested best actress award.Best British film was My Summer of Love, the story of two young women and their developing relationship, while Foxx's movie Ray, a bio-pic of late singer Ray Charles, also took best sound.The Aviator was declared best film, and its star Cate Blanchett won best supporting actress.Jamie Foxx won best actor for Ray, while British actor Clive Owen took best supporting actor for Closer.DiCaprio, who lost out on the best actor Bafta to Foxx, will face him again at the Academy Awards in two weeks' time.Other winners included The Motorcycle Diaries which took best foreign film and best music, while Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind won best original screenplay and best editing.Hollywood blockbuster The Aviator and low-budget British movie Vera Drake have shared the main honours at the 2005 Bafta film awards.The Aviator took four awards in all, also collecting best make-up and hair and production design, while Vera Drake also scooped best costume design.Her director Leigh, who beat Martin Scorsese to the best director award, told the audience: ""We always say it was a surprise and sometimes I've said it and not meant it.But big British hope Kate Winslet walked away empty-handed on Saturday despite two nominations for best actress.I'm so thrilled and so grateful and I'm delighted that the success of Vera Drake has boosted sales of hair nets and pinnies, which is very good,"" she said on accepting her award.Best actor Foxx could not make the ceremony, but actress Helen Mirren read out his acceptance speech"
Film star Fox behind theatre bid,"He was brought on board to save the theatre by Mr Palmer, a long-standing friend of 40 years.The Palace Theatre, which will be known as The Pavilion Repertory Theatre, was sold to an undisclosed bidder at auction 13 months ago for £340,000.Fox told the South Wales Evening Post that after visiting the theatre he was surprised by its beauty.Leading actor Edward Fox is one of the men behind plans to reopen a Swansea theatre thought to be Wales' oldest.They will set up a charity to raise money to buy the Palace Theatre, and hope to reopen it to audiences in summer 2006.""If in five years' time the theatre can function in all areas without me, I shall be well satisfied having helped to create a vital living theatre for the city,"" he added.Last year, roads around the theatre were cordoned off when masonry from its roof fell onto a car, but engineers said they were happy that it was safe.""Two years ago I decided to return to Swansea and do something for the city,"" said Mr Palmer.""We need at least £75,000 to secure a deposit on the building and we've only got two months to do that,"" said Mr Poulton"
Shark Tale DVD is US best-seller,Oscar-nominated animation Shark Tale has raked in $80m (£42.4m) in the first week of its US DVD release becoming the year's best-selling home video so far.Shark Tale is now the sixth-highest earning DVD for first week sales.The tally for its DVD and video sales soared past the film's opening week US box office takings of $56m (£29.7m)
Lopez misses UK charity premiere,"The film's director Peter Chelsom said he was disappointed that Lopez did not attend.""I'm so proud of Shall We Dance and was looking forward to visiting London,"" she said.Jennifer Lopez cancelled an appearance at the UK charity premiere of her new movie saying she was too ill to fly.The actress and singer dropped out at the last minute and has now cancelled all European promotion of the film Shall We Dance?She said: ""I very much wanted to be in London but unfortunately I'm not well.I know it's true that she's not well because she has also cancelled her promotional tour.Co-star Richard Gere attended the event held in aid of the tsunami appeal.Gere, 55, greeted the crowd and signed autographs, accompanied by his wife Carey Lowell"
Super Size Me wins writers' award,"Spurlock was given his award on the same day the European Court of Human Rights ruled that two UK activists should have been given legal aid in their long fight against a McDonald's libel action.The Oscar-nominated film followed Spurlock as he ate only McDonald's fast food for an entire month.Spurlock was given the award at a special ceremony at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood on Tuesday.McDonald's announced it was to scrap its ""supersized"" meals last year, but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by Spurlock's film.Spurlock set out to discover the effect of living on nothing but McDonald's for a month, upgrading to supersize portions when offered"
Original Exorcist to be screened,"Schrader was replaced by director Renny Harlin who made a new version of the film which debuted in 2004.However, in August 2003 it emerged that producers Morgan Creek were shelving Schrader's version of the film, having complained it was not scary enough.The film, directed by Paul Schrader, will be screened on 18 March at the International Festival of Fantastic Film in Brussels.Skarsgard then replaced Neeson in the role of Father Merrin, made famous by Max Von Sydow in the 1973 film.Other films at the festival in the Belgium capital, which runs from 11-26 March, include the US horror hit Boogeyman and the forthcoming sequel Ring 2, as well as a selection of films adapted from the works of Jules Verne.The psychological drama stars Stellan Skarsgard and foreruns the 1973 film"
Oscar nominees lack pulling power,"The biggest box office hitter among this year's nominees is The Aviator, which has taken $90m (£48m) in the US, although takings in the UK have reached only £7m so far.This year's clutch of Oscar nominees have been the least popular for 20 years according to box office figures.""When Titanic does $1.8bn in worldwide box office, you've got a lot of people with a vested interest.""In the US the five nominated for best film have been seen by 50% fewer people than movies in previous years.But many in the film industry do not equate award and box office success.While the awards are not based on box office popularity there is concern for the ratings of the televised ceremony.The film had taken $500m (£264m) worldwide before the ceremony, and eventually took $1.8bn (£952m).About 51 million people in the US have seen this year's nominees, compared with between 100 million and 118 million in recent years.This is about the industry bestowing awards on what they think are the best films of the year.""And the show reaped its biggest audience in 1997 when Titanic took home 11 Oscars"
Hitch holds on to US box office,"Smith's comedy will be the first US movie released this year to top the $100m (£52.7m) mark.Oscar contenders The Aviator, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes and wine-tasting comedy Sideways, both held onto positions in the top 10.Will Smith's first romantic comedy, Hitch, has topped the North American box office for a second weekend.Comedy adventure Son of the Mask, came in at number four with $7.7m (£4.1m), just ahead of Oscar favourite Million Dollar Baby at five"
Tarantino to direct CSI episode,"Ms Mendelsohn said the production team had been trying for a while to get Tarantino to direct an episode of CSI, and added that he was a fan of the forensic drama.Film director Quentin Tarantino is to direct an episode of US television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.She said he finally agreed a few weeks ago while CSI was doing some location shooting in Las Vegas and the show's stars persuaded him.The Oscar-winning Pulp Fiction director has also written an original story for the season finale episode.CSI's co-producer, Carol Mendelsohn, said the episode would have ""more bugs and blood"" than usual"
Bollywood DVD fraudster is jailed,"Buhecha was previously a legitimate distributor of Bollywood films, but was suspended and sued by his employers for dealing in illegal copies of Bollywood classic Mohabbatein.Buhecha, who made £26,000 per month from his illegal trade, was called ""one of the biggest Bollywood pirates in the UK"" by the sentencing judge.A major distributor of pirated DVDs of Bollywood films has been sent to prison for three years.The judge in the case, which lasted seven days, said that ""a heavy penalty was called for because of the enormous damage Buhecha caused to legitimate business"".An operation was launched against Buhecha in 2002 after complaints were received about his activities.Jayanti Amarishi Buhecha from Cambridge was found guilty of two trademark offences last month, and sentenced at Harrow Crown Court, London, on Tuesday.Legitimate Bollywood film distributors have hailed the conviction as ""a major boost"""
US 'afflicted' with awards fatigue,"And Mr Goodridge said best film and director were between Martin Scorsese's Aviator and Million Dollar Baby.""As Chris Rock accurately said, they're about celebrity and fashion,"" Mr Strauss said.""Film-makers haven't produced films that people adore this year,"" he said.""I hope this is the year for small films to triumph,"" he said.Mr Karger, whose favourite film of the year was Mike Leigh's abortion drama Vera Drake, stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments.""Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby affected people emotionally, which is why it will beat Aviator, which was about technical artistry not feelings,"" Mr Karger said.Mr Strauss doubted whether Rock would make an impact, but added: ""I'm all for lower ratings though - there are far more important things going on than the Oscars.""The near constant flow of US film awards, representing directors, actors and producers' guilds, also means ""few surprises"" are left by the time the Oscar ceremony is upon us, he said.The film world and media may be wild about the Oscars but cinema-goers and the TV-viewing public are sick of watching award ceremonies, according to some LA film critics.Mr Karger said the comic might boost younger viewers, but Mike Goodridge thought Rock's humour could prompt America's conservative states to switch off.""2004's films could be a reaction to 9/11 - there was a realisation in America that things might not be so rosy after all.Screen International's US editor Mike Goodridge thinks 2004's films have simply not grabbed the public's imagination"

Briton wins short film Oscar,"""The other nominees said they made their films for this reason or that - they had something to say.""I felt so privileged to have a thousand people watching my film on the biggest screen I've ever seen,"" says Arnold.I'm overwhelmed by all the fuss,"" she said.Three of the five nominees in the live-action short film category at this year's Oscars were British.The image that sparked the film was that of a wasp crawling into a baby's mouth.Last week, the trio attended an official screening of all the nominated short films at the Academy's headquarters in Beverly Hills.""But even though my film has won 30 awards worldwide (including one at Sundance last month), I'd still be proud of it - even if it hadn't won any.""I'm still reeling.""""We've all been overwhelmed by the response and can't get it in perspective yet.That said, she is currently working on a feature film with Dogville and Dancer In The Dark director Lars Von Trier.""It's all a bit like a beauty contest - all the films are great and so different"
Sideways dominates Spirit awards,"It was named best film while Alexander Payne won best director and best screenplay, along with writing partner Jim Taylor.Moreno is also nominated for best actress at the Oscars.The best first screenplay award went to Joshua Marston for Maria Full of Grace.Oscar-nominated euthanasia film The Sea Inside from Spain won best foreign film, while Metallica: Some Kind Of Monster was awarded best documentary.Scrubs star Zach Braff won the award for best first feature for Garden State, which he wrote, directed and starred in.Other winners included Catalina Sandino Moreno, who took best actress for her role as a drug smuggler in the Colombian drama Maria Full of Grace"
Arnold congratulated on Oscar win,"Arnold's film Wasp won the best live action short film award on Sunday.Wasp, which was commissioned by the Film Council and Channel 4, beat films by fellow UK nominees Gary McKendry and Ashvin Kumar to the prize.The film has already won over 30 other international awards including the Sundance Short Film Prize.Oscar-winner Andrea Arnold has been congratulated by the UK Film Council, the organisation which partly funded her project.""The UK Film Council spends millions of pounds of lottery investment on short filmmaking in Britain every year,"" said chief executive officer John Woodward"
Eastwood's Baby scoops top Oscars,"The boxing drama was named best picture and Eastwood pipped Scorsese to best director, while its stars Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman won acting awards.Born into Brothels, about the children of prostitutes in Calcutta, was named best documentary, The Sea Inside was named best foreign language film and Finding Neverland got the accolade for best musical score.Many expected this to be Scorsese's year - but he was unsuccessful in the best director category for the fifth time in his career.Jamie Foxx picked up best actor for playing soul star Ray Charles in Ray.The Aviator took five prizes including best supporting actress for Cate Blanchett.Instead, Eastwood took his second Oscar for best director after winning for Unforgiven in 1993.""It was a wonderful adventure,"" Eastwood said.Cate Blanchett, who won for playing late screen legend Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, said her award was ""an indescribable surprise and honour"".In other awards, cartoon hit The Incredibles won best animated feature and best sound editing.Spider-Man 2 triumphed in the visual effects category, Ray won best sound mixing and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events picked up best make-up.This was the fourth nomination of his career but his first win.""That love for Ray Charles was deep down in the earth somewhere and you opened it up.Hilary Swank picked up her second best actress Oscar for playing a female boxer in Million Dollar Baby, beating stars including Annette Bening, Kate Winslet and Imelda Staunton.Morgan Freeman beat actors including Clive Owen, Jamie Foxx and Alan Alda to the prize for best supporting actor.And Jamie Foxx, who had two nominations this year, paid tribute to the ""beautiful legacy"" of soul legend Ray Charles, who died last year, and thanked director Taylor Hackford"
British stars denied major Oscars,"Cinematographer John Mathieson, who was nominated for Gladiator in 2001, was also up for The Phantom of the Opera but lost to The Aviator.It was also a debut nomination for Staunton, 49, who played abortionist Vera Drake in Mike Leigh's film.Despite three nominations, Mike Leigh's Vera Drake failed to take the director or screenplay awards and there was no prize for star Imelda Staunton.A spokesman for the UK Film Council said: ""It is disappointing not to have more British winners.""Winslet said she was ""ecstatic"" about the fourth Oscar nomination of her career, this time for her lead role in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.He added: ""It was extraordinary to have 24 British nominees in the initial list of nominees.""Arnold, who presented children's television shows Number 73 and Motormouth in the 1980s, said it was ""totally overwhelming"" to win.Earlier British costume designer Sandy Powell won the Oscar for The Aviator, beating Finding Neverland's UK designer Alexandra Byrne in the process.British hopes of winning major Oscars were dashed as UK stars failed to win acting and directing prizes.Finding Neverland garnered another nomination for British talent, with Gemma Jackson shortlisted for the art direction prize"
Lee to create new film superhero,"A third Spider-Man film is scheduled for release in 2007.Paramount Pictures, the studio behind the film, have revealed few details about the project but say it has the potential to spawn a series of films.Comic book veteran Stan Lee is to team up with producer Robert Evans to create a movie featuring a new superhero.However, the Spider-Man series has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) worldwide.Lee is best known for his work on Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk"
Jackson film 'absolute disaster',"Ms Kite said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against Mr Jackson.Ms Kite began to work for Mr Jackson in February 2003, after the controversial film was televised in the US and Europe.Ms Kite said she received a phone call on 13 February 2003 from a Jackson associate, Marc Schaffel, who said the boy and his family had left the Neverland ranch where they had been staying.The Smoking Gun website publication was ""beyond disaster"", Ms Kite said.Ms Kite told the court she had later asked Jackson's lawyer, David LeGrand, what had happened.Ms Kite suggested Jackson's associates had been intent on launching a smear campaign against the accuser's family after the airing of Martin Bashir's film Living with Michael Jackson.A PR expert has told the Michael Jackson child abuse trial that the TV documentary at the heart of the case was an ""absolute disaster"".Questioned by the prosecution, Ms Kite said her plan had been to move media coverage of the star away from a focus on his human frailties to concentrate more on his musical genius.In the prosecution's opening statement on Monday, Tom Sneddon told the court that Mr Jackson had shown the boy porn and plied him with wine, in order to molest him"
France set for new Da Vinci novel,"Angels and Demons was written before The Da Vinci Code, which has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, and been translated into more than 40 languages, since it was released in 2003.The Da Vinci Code is set in Paris - including the Louvre - and has sold around one million copies in France.The Da Vinci Code is being made into a film starring Tom Hanks.The main character, Robert Langdon, also appears in Angels and Demons.Such is the success of The Da Vinci Code in France, special tours have been organised to trace Langdon's footsteps, including the the Louvre museum and the Saint Sulpice Church.Angels and Demons is set mainly in Rome as symbologist Robert Langdon follows a 400-year-old trail to try to uncover a plot by an ancient brotherhood, The Illuminati, to blow up the Vatican"
